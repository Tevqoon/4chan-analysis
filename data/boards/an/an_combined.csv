There are major issues with scaleless ball pythons and they shouldn&#039;t be bred.<br>My research into scaleless Pantherophis seems to indicate that they reach adult size and have normal lifespans while being more prone to minor shedding issues and being more prone to superficial injuries from sharp things (not to downplay the potential for infection etc, reptiles aren&#039;t as resilient to minor cuts as mammals in general). Not as fit for survival in the wild, but they do fine in captivity.<br>The only other species with a scaleless morph I&#039;m familiar with are western diamondback rattlesnakes, and those fuckers thrive in captivity. They do look even more scrotum-like than other scaleless snakes and their tail is a fleshy nub, but the species is as hardy as snakes get and scaleless examples are not an exception, just need the same minor accomodations.<br>Again I agree with you on the scaleless balls, think spider balls and jaguar carpets need to stop being bred, and making hybrids to spread morphs to different species is fucking terrible. Conflating those with morphs that thrive just hurts your argument.",,,,,,,,1612978222,,,3679773,,,,,,,3679773,,an

The cerebral capacity of the bull-dog is sensibly smaller than in any other race; and it is doubtless to the decrease of the encephalon that we must attribute its inferiority to all others in every thing relating to intelligence. The bull-dog is scarcely capable of any education, and is fitted for nothing but combat and ferocity.<br><br>This animal takes his name from his having been employed, in former times, in assaulting the bull, and he is used for the same purpose at the present day, in those districts where this brutal amusement is still practised.<br><br>Nothing can exceed the fury with which the bull-dog falls upon all other animals, and the invincible obstinacy with which he maintains his hold. In attacking the bull, he always assails him in front, and generally fastens upon his lip, tongue, or eye, where he holds and hangs on, in spite of the most desperate efforts of the other to free himself from his antagonist, which affords ample proof of the amazing strength and power of this animal.<br><br>Whenever a bull-dog attacks any of the extremities of the body, it is invariably considered a mark of his degeneracy from the original purity of blood. Puppies will assail a bull, and thereby give a decided proof of their breed, when only six months old; and, if permitted, will rather suffer themselves to be destroyed than relinquish the contest.",,,,,,,,1612761426,,,3678334,,,,,,,3678334,,an

But there is an extreme difference in the aggressiveness of a pit bull and rarely will you get a biting lab (over my 10 years of dog training i have only heard about one lab they had to muzzle or it would have killed all her puppies. I didnt even ever meet a fucking lab that had an aggressive temperament.) i&#039;ve met shit collies and shit huskies too often though. Most of the time its the owners fault on why they allow their dogs to be little shits that run all over therm and you can find it out with a short interview. Some people buy pets as toys, me and my family have been breeding labs since 1979 and only try to better the breed by finding high quality labs to breed to our females. breed up not down",,,,,,,,1613008176,,,3682171,,,,,,,3682171,,an

She only loves two people me and my dad barks at everyone else in fear because we took her to the vet too many times. She is an excellent guard dog though and lets me know when the mail or UPS comes all the time. and when shes barking at something outside i yell NO HERE and she sprints back in the house. look at what you can do with a neurotic lab though<br>https://youtu.be/hKhkqERPCd4",,,,,,,,1613009946,,,3682171,,,,,,,3682171,,an

Larger tanks can handle more dissolved solids, have a larger biofilter, and have more water volume, so they can withstand quite a bit more mistakes or neglect than nano-tanks. 40 gallons isn&#039;t bad, neither is 55, I just would stock it relatively light at first. Don&#039;t add too much too fast, let your biofilter build up (so it can handle the waste generated) and take it slow.

They can live their full natural lifespan in such a tank, I haven&#039;t seen evidence of increased mortality due to low flow. However, in a tank that has high flow areas they often seem to gravitate towards them and seek that out, to the point that a lot of people have caught them climbing into their hang on back filters.

Rapid climate change thinned the ranks of existing terrestrial fauna, and the hardy semi-aquatic slime-hoppers rushed in to fill the gaps. They are well adapted to life on land now, and have established themselves as vegetarian generalists: the &quot;hose-pigs&quot;. <br><br>Three pairs of columnar &quot;legs&quot; (in truth just derived keratinous pegs anchored by muscle) support a stout body reinforced by dermal plates. Their heads sport a proper lensed eye now, and what used to be a simple proboscis has developed into a dexterous trunk. A fatty hump on their backs acts as a reservoir for moisture and nutrients; an adaptation which allowed them to better endure global temperature increases. The venomous spines (which were a lucky side effect of a more primitive metabolism) are gone -- but the scarcity of large predators in this era means defense is no longer a priority for the hose-pigs. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;It is sexy time. But how will our hose-pigs demonstrate their fitness to potential mates? An impressive display structure? An auditory show? An elaborate display? There is also the problem of interspecific competition: as the climate stabilizes and more species evolve to exploit resource niches, being an all-purpose-eater may no longer be the most successful strategy. Will the hose-pigs browse higher up? Graze lower down? Or do something else entirely?

What if he used his trunk to enter burrows of smaller animals and dig for bugs and things to eat? The lack of depth perception wouldn&#039;t affect that.

Or maybe if they&#039;ve got a nice fat hump it will attract a mate. Maybe combined with some honks from the trunk.

It&#039;s not really a controversial opinion, but I feel like that&#039;s the special sauce that let humans make the leap to civilization. There are so many steps along the way way to civilization that happened almost as soon as it was possible. Life. Energetic life. Multicellular life. Complex tissues. Encephalization. But then there&#039;s a long gap for evidence of real intelligence (though that one is hard to see) and an even larger gap until noticeable tool modification. I have a strong suspicion that this is the Great Filter. Look at the confluence of events that led to humans being good tool users. Plants evolve into a form that supports brachiation. Dinosaurs go extinct. Mammals radiate and eventually brachiate based on that kind of tree. Forest recede and bipedal brachiators have to sink or walk. And then tons of opportunity for extinction from there before we get to where we are now. <br><br>I&#039;m not saying it has to work that way, but it given how long it took it seems likely that it was a rare event.",,,,,,,,1612821744,,,3664859,,,,,,,3664859,,an

In 1970, American palaeontologists Elwyn Simons and Peter Ettel approximated a height of almost 2.7 m (9 ft) and a weight of up to 270 kg (600 lb), which is about 42% heavier than a male gorilla. In 2017, Chinese palaeoanthropologist Yingqi Zhang and American anthropologist Terry Harrison suggested a body mass of 200–300 kg (440–660 lb), though conceded this was likely an overestimate and it is impossible to obtain a reliable body mass estimate without more complete remains.[2]</span>",,,,,,,,1612668482,,,3676852,,,,,,,3676852,,an

But some of their thoughtless navigational instincts resemble intelligence, which led them to be more formally studied than any other mammal. It helps that as scavenging omnivores, they are very easily and reliably motivated, and as small animals, they are easy to manipulate and experiment on. If anything their lack of intelligence makes them easier to study because it&#039;s less likely for a rat to show true disinterest and apathy (something that requires a higher level of intelligence).<br><br>People say so much bullshit about rats like they&#039;re special but pretty much every mammal is about as intelligent if not much more intelligent. But most are harder to get to cooperate with studies. They&#039;re still not smart enough to understand what we want to do and do it, and their natural tendencies don&#039;t align well with intelligence tests. Many are even smart enough to, in their little food driven brains, decide the test isn&#039;t worth their time.<br><br>If humanity goes extinct the next human will probably be another primate.

1577,3681039,02/09/21(Tue)20:52:25,Anonymous,,I had a cat that lived to be 20. Im lucky that she died naturally of old age. I was incredibly sad but she was a bit distant from me. She didn&#039;t really like to cuddle <br><br>My other cat however is 17 approaching 18. She is very attached to me and is very affectionate. She almost always sleeps in my bed. I figured she would live till 20 like my previous cat however she has fallen ill recently. My mom took her to the vet to get examined and xrays showed fluid in her lungs. There was surgery to get the fluid removed but doctors said she may not survive it and that maybe its time to put her down. I was completely destroyed. I hated the fact that I had to decide whether to euthanize the cat i had since middle school and me not being there in her final moments. I cried my eyes out at work. I made the decision to pay the $800 for the surgery. She had to stay over night at the vet and it felt so odd her not being there in my room. Surgery was a success and shes back home now but I dont know how long she has left. I hate the idea of having to euthanize her. I&#039;d prefer if she died peacefully and naturally like my previous cat.<br><br>I cried my eyes out yesterday /an/. Its been such a long time since I cried. Im not religious but yesterday at work I went to the bathroom and prayed for my cat. I wept like crazy in there. She was so strong about a 2 weeks ago. It pains me to see her so weak now. Lab results to see what the fluid is will arrive next week. Im sorry if this was a long post but I dont have anyone to tell this to.

I had a parakeet named Charlotte, I was pretty inventive as a kid and I took a speaker made a tape recording of me saying pretty bird and put it in a toy of hers that looked like another parakeet she loved. Taught her to say pretty bird in two days, she even would make the click noise of the tape being looped. She would spend hour in front of the fish tank watching fish loved her one day the lid was left off the fish tank and she fucking drowned. I’m still a little pissed off but I was ten and that was la long time ago. <br>My hamster named Husker who had a 300$ elaborated cage in my room escaped one night and I fucking stepped on him walking to the bathroom late at night to take a piss woke my parents up and balled for two days. Told myself no more pets for a while until I got a dog.<br>Richard motherfucking Nixon he went with me every where his whole life, had spine issues towards the end of his life and one day he just layed down and started breathing heavy the vet wasn’t in the office that day so I just layed on the floor with him for half a day petting him.

For every stupid kid taunting a gorilla there&#039;s way more actual bonding moments between keepers and the animals that outweigh however much time kids are being stupid. Many zoos and aquariums also contribute substantially to conservation efforts as well as wildlife rehabilitation. The place I worked at had a breeding program to reintroduce native turtles into local wetlands they were partnered with other zoos with. Even Seaworld has massive wildlife rescue operations along with their SeaWorld Busch Gardens Conservation Fund<br><br>There was a time when zoos were held under less scrutiny than they are today. That image has never gone away even though most zoos underwent radical changes to their entire way of functioning. If your girlfriend cares about animals at all she&#039;s learn about the programs your local zoos offer for conservation and organize against any SPECIFIC ethical issues that the zoos are slow to change on. Even if all of this isn&#039;t enough then the biggest shocker is going to be many species are now exclusively only thriving in captivity and efforts to reintroduce their populations have either failed entirely or are simply too much for any organization to attempt. Loss of habitat, changing climates, the massive black market for poached goods, and total lack of an international effort to stop these extinction events are massive fucking problems in the world today and the existence of zoos is not one of them<br><br><br>https://www.aza.org/aza-safe<br><br>https://apnews.com/press-release/pr<wbr>-prnewswire/e8602d1b4ecc09c7ab74dcc<wbr>e70af5f14",,,,,,,,1612915307,,,3680489,,,,,,,3680489,,an

He was often given delicious human foods as treats life ice cream and fast foods. Then when he got older they started to think he was too big to be treated in such a lax manner (and admittedly they were right). So they put him in a normal orangutan enclosure for the rest of his life and did not give him the human treats he was used to even though he would often sign for it. The heart breaking thing about him is that he was raised as if he was a human, he literally attended pre-school classes alongside humans and enjoyed painting. He literally, not as a joke, went to college and lived and walked among humans. Attending lectures, being in the yearbook, and making friends. Then they suddenly tranquilized him and put him in a cage. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;It was weeks before Dr Miles was allowed to see him.

There&#039;s an ash tree growing just outside the frame of the photo so I&#039;m pretty sure I can do this. <br>Are there any pointers for my plan and how to regenerate the patch? Those idiots moved out and I don&#039;t want to spend money to get rid of their rubbish so native stuff that can cover it properly while providing wildlife benefit would be great. Already have bramble growing near it but would like to confine it to its own area. <br>my end goal is to create a mini copse of rowan trees with some native shrubs and wildflowers within a timespan of 10 years.<br>the whole area is roughly 3m x 3m or 9 square metres,20210205_162237,.jpg,1878.0,1292.0,125.0,85.0,1612547276097.0,1612547276,rToVDRe4+E3L0Se+mDN9bg==,2468774.0,3673398,,,,,,,3673398,,an

Most dogs are in shelter for a reason. Most people don’t “get a puppy and then give it up because they are no longer cute”. Most people did have plan to have a grown up dog but could not handle the behavioral problem of that specific dog. Many people simple set a too perfect plan, expectation, and timeline for raising a puppy to adulthood and then cannot accommodate when it get altered. This can easily happen during adolescence and that’s why adolescence dog get regime quite frequently.<br>The adoption market is even tougher nowadays due to COVID. Quality adoptable dog is even harder to come by<br>As a first fine owner, it can be like being thrown in the deep end and if you can make it through, you’ll learn a lot about dog ownership. However, you have to prepare yourself mentally because it won’t be easy. A lot of frustration can stemmed from you feeling that all of the problems you spent fixing now could have been prevented if the previous owner put in some work during puppyhood. The volume of work to train an adopted dog might not be as much as a brand new puppy, but the work is more difficult<br>On the other hand, the volume of work of getting a puppy is huge. Getting a puppy come down to responsibility and understand that any mistakes you make, you have to spend more effort fixing it down the line. In that case, at least you know you are fixing the problem you yourself caused. You have to understand to not to blame the dog as well. However, if you are willing to bear the responsibility, raising a puppy can be more satisfying.",,,,,,,,1612142041,,,3668765,,,,,,,3668765,,an

A few times she’s peed on the floor, we take her out, she pees, come back in, she pees on the floor, and we take her out again. She doesn’t owe in her crate though - never has.

Right now your puppy&#039;s minimum is every half-hour. You basically have to break the cycle of them urinating in the house by starting from the minimum and working up, backtracking if there&#039;s an accident. Additionally, the puppy should not be outside of a crate, pen, or gated area without supervision because you need to interrupt the act if it happens and if they are contained they are less likely to urinate. Finally, consider starting with potty bells or another type of signal.

Because she is very large and swims, the dose does not always last the full 4 weeks, so I apply every 3 weeks. I have done NexGard before, however prefer Advantix because it does not require the ticks to latch before it kills them and it also helps with mosquitos and biting flies.<br><br>If you have a phobia of ticks, I can tell you that you should be more concerned about your environment than having a dog. My neighbors don&#039;t have pets but their grandson got nasty chronic Lyme from playing in their yard, and my father is on antibiotics for the rest of his life for a combo of Anaplasmosis/Ehrliciosis in addition to other issues.

I raise and breed black and yellow Labradors (because chocolates are mostly knuckleheads bred for color, I have met and trained with a bunch of them) and have with my dad and grandpa since 1979. I’m not claiming to know a bunch of information on all types of dogs but I am pretty good at training my dogs and spend a lot of time on YouTube watching training videos so I could help out with some video links and tips. This winter I spent a lot of time doing some advanced potty training with my dogs and taught them all to shit mainly in tall grass where I don’t have to pick it up. In the spring through fall I work for a dog trainer and my job is mostly cleaning shit and throwing dead ducks at long distances for dogs to hunt and find (it’s rewarding enough but I don’t get paid much);I just get a kick out of watching dogs use their natural ability to work with humans, I do frisbee with my energetic dogs. Part of my job once a week is to watch a pen raised duck get shot once a week for about 15-25 dogs (I don’t hunt or shoot the ducks at my job because I take care of the pen daily and have a personal thing about killing that many animals but it’s dog work and cool sometimes) The dogs really get a kick out of fetching a fresh dead duck or cripple flyer, and can’t stop enjoying their excitement.<br><br>Watch these brutal videos to get feeling of what training a hunting dog is all about.<br>https://youtu.be/wnO46iNatII<br>https://youtu.be/FWGo9qWetRE",903588AE-CCEF-4D87-875F-D1B9B502A988,.jpg,4032.0,3024.0,125.0,93.0,1612819034103.0,1612819034,1SWGh+9dQrUZaW9nvIsBpg==,3928061.0,3668765,,,,,,,3668765,,an

And then immediately strap the e collar on the when they are still young to work on discipline to get a firm no and a crisp here making sure they drop what they are doing and come to you. we dont use stay most of the time because sit is taught to made the dog stay until released.<br>To build drive we introduce our dogs to birds at an early age by getting them a pen raised duck or pigeon to fetch while it is still alive. Before they are seven weeks old they are given a pigeon as puppies and they usually play smear the queer and rip it apart with their sharp puppy teeth.<br>You don&#039;t need a collar to train your dog but you cant easy accomplish blind retrieves and long distance hand signals shocking your dog as a correction because your voice loses its effectiveness at about 300 yards which is a typical blind at a field trial. Impressive work to watch at a field trial and the dogs arent allowed to have any type of collar around their neck at them.<br>Their are very sensitive dogs and I have seen my boss break a dog before (but there are other training teqniques we use to build drive but hunting labs seem to be able to handle the pressure and tend to get really intense about the work.

She describes herself as ‘cat intuitive’, and says that by sitting down with a pet, or even just looking at a photograph of the animal, she can pick up the kitty’s emotions. <br><br>This helps her to understand why a cat is behaving in a certain way, allowing her to coach its owners to help the pet feel more comfortable. She ditched her corporate job as a civil servant last year in order to pursue her dreams of educating cat owners and now runs her business, Naturally Cats, full time. Julie-Anne said: <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;‘I can’t explain the science or the logic behind it because it is more of an emotional and energetic connection between myself and the cats. &#039;</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;‘It’s almost like there is a connection between our feelings when I see them. You can get behaviour cues from looking at cats, but I feel more than that.&#039;</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;‘When I connect to my breath and to the moment and stop all the noise of day to day stuff that goes through my head, I am able to feel how the cat feels.&#039;</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;‘All of a sudden, I might become angry or I might feel scared – that’s what the cat is directly feeling, it’s not just my interpretation. I can actually feel it within myself.’</span><br><br>Julie-Anne, who lives in Plymouth, Devon, says she realised that she had a strong connection with cats after visiting a zoo with her husband Rob back in 2012. Stopping at a large cat enclosure where a cheetah lived, Julie-Anne was suddenly overcome with sadness and began to cry. It wasn’t until later that day that the couple found out that the cheetah had just lost their mate and was grieving the male’s death.",1594735412930,.jpg,681.0,674.0,250.0,247.0,1612696856885.0,1612696856,PyJjEuJhAgTSaVsNv6nswA==,49322.0,0,0.0,0.0,uk-woman-quits-her-job-to-work-fulltime-as-a-cat,18.0,2.0,19.0,3677820,,an

Pet care in general has advanced exponentially and I think a pet in 2021 has a better likleyhood of getting proper care than today. I also kind of make up for it by calling out animal mistreatment when I see it.

Your dog doesn’t have enough for some reason, and its blood is also leaking out (the bruising, and probably elsewhere inside his body too). His kidneys are likely fucked too now at this point. There are lots and lots of things that can cause this and the messed up heart, but none of them are good. I highly doubt he’s going to recover.<br><br>For your other dog, are you still giving him heartworm prevention every month? Has he had a negative heartworm test in the past year? Is he tested yearly? Houston has a horrible heartworm problem because of the high mosquito population that pretty much exists year-round. <br>For his joints, ask the vet if there is a supplement or medication they would recommend.

If you want to be sure they can&#039;t dig it up, you put the whole pot (or bamboo, corkbark tubes) into the substrate with a disc on top, then there&#039;ll be no way in hell they can mess up the roots. But it&#039;ll severly restrict how big your plant can be. And watering is a bit more tricky since it&#039;s way easier to flood a potted plant without drainage.<br>Only downside is that you can&#039;t grow &quot;ranking&quot; plants (I don&#039;t know the english term, sorry) like Pothos in a disc or pot. Since it grows a stem below ground and then shoots up a new section of the plant that won&#039;t be covered by a disc. But creeping/wandering plants shouldn&#039;t do any diffrent with, or without.<br><br>I suggest you just try. You can also burry a corkbark tube, a big one for the roachs to dig into making it the only place it can burry. Thereby not messing your plants.

If it&#039;s soft after a molt, though, crickets are known to be very aggressive and injure/kill, well, just about anything. They&#039;re aggressive even to lizards after a shed. Otherwise though, they&#039;re honestly not a huge deal. If you&#039;re worried you can always cripple them a bit. Regardless, I prefer dubia roaches for most things just because crickets smell awful, and roaches surprisingly smell fine (sweet, even). All said, crickets can still be amazing because they have a very hard time climbing glass and don&#039;t burrow. Mealworms, roaches, and many other feeder alternatives like to burrow which depending on your animal/enclosure, means your animal will not be fed.",,,,,,,,1612126553,,,3649668,,,,,,,3649668,,an

The purpose of a drainage layer is that if you overwater, instead of it getting soggy or overflown (watery even) substrate it just drains down and eventually due to vaporation goes back into the substrate.<br><br>If you are affraid you could overwater your terrarium plants, or have a species that require a lot of humidity I&#039;d suggest you make one. But, you could in theory just water the &quot;right amount&quot; each time, and never need one in the first place. However, I wouldn&#039;t count on it, you&#039;d have to be very good at watering at the right time, and the right amount each time. But, it&#039;s still a way to make your set-up idiot proof.<br>If you have a species that require about 50 % humidity, and have plants that need to dry out (or can tolorate it) in between waterings, like in a desert or arid landscape, then it would actually be detremential to have a drainage layer. As excess water would raise the humidity and make the substrate more wet.<br>As for sprintails, they need some moisture and water, hence why a desert set-up would kill them off. If you spot clean (ie. take out the dead prey) you could get away with just changing the substrate once every few years or so if you don&#039;t want or can&#039;t have springtails.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;they can get tangled up in or destroy the drainage barrier dividing the drainage layer</span><br>You can use &quot;weed blocker&quot;, which is a type of garden mesh very fine, like cloth. But it takes a while for water to drain through, so you&#039;d have to be carefull not to water too often, or too quickly as it would just make your substrate soggy.",,,,,,,,1612522361,,,3649668,,,,,,,3649668,,an

Being out there in the wilderness away from society, camping, and stalking prey in hopes for a great reward of meat is amazing. Personally I get a greater appreciation for nature, the animals I hunt, and where meat comes from by doing this. Some other hunters out there are absolute dumb fuck losers who kill more than they can eat for fun though. and it isn’t for protecting native landscape either because when we use poison to kill rats and there are some deer by kill, they complain that we are killing too many game animals. But that being said these hunters are few and far between where I live.

Shelties are quite well known for being vocal, and aloof with strangers - you really do need to get the socialisation in as early as you possibly can.

5263,3670110,01/31/21(Sun)10:58:06,Anonymous,,"Anons, please help. I got three feeder rats (I didn&#039;t want them to be eated) originally under the assumption they were all male. They were all healthy, I checked their nose and eyes for any porphyrin and noticed none. I also held each to my ear to check their breathing and it was clear. However, after a week or two, I noticed one of them hadn&#039;t grown insanely huge testicles. That&#039;s fine, I can separate them, the cage I got is large enough and comes with that ability. I&#039;m not leaving her alone, though. So I went to a different store and got another feeder rat because it pains me so much that they are sold to be killed at such a young age. I did the same, her breathing was fine, no porphyrin. When I got home, she was sneezing a bit, but I assumed it was stress, all of them had a few new home sneezes for the first day or two. Her&#039;s didn&#039;t go away, though, and eventually all of my rats were sick. I took them all to the vet and they were prescribed baytril. They seemed to heal over the first couple days, but quickly got sick again. The original sick lady was so bad that I ended up rushing her to an emergency vet. Here she was taken off of baytril and prescribed azithromycin. She&#039;s been on this for a bit, but the others have gone back to being sick (though not as bad as she is,) and she&#039;s not responding to the medication. I love them so much, what do I do? How do I help them? I am giving them as much love as I can. I take them into my bathroom and let the shower run hot water so it gets steamy and helps clear their nose, but it doesn&#039;t matter how much I clear their noses if they&#039;re still sick.",10000000000_dead_snakes,.png,515.0,392.0,125.0,95.0,1612108686671.0,1612108686,+iXpJSblPB75+t10yKvu6g==,8218.0,3652991,,,,,,,3652991,,an

This is specifically a killer whale named Old Tom from around Eden, Australia.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The killers of Eden or Twofold Bay killers were a group of killer whales (Orcinus orca) known for their co-operation with human hunters of cetacean species. They were seen near the port of Eden in southeastern Australia between 1840 and 1930. A pod of killer whales, which included amongst its members a distinctive male called Old Tom, would assist whalers in hunting baleen whales. The killer whales would find target whales, shepherd them into Twofold Bay or neighbouring regions of coast, and then often swim many kilometres away from the location of the hunt to alert the whalers at their cottage to their presence and often help to kill the whales. </span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Old Tom&#039;s role was commonly to alert the human whalers to the presence of a baleen whale in the bay by breaching or tailslapping at the mouth of the Kiah River, which is one of the smallest rivers, where the Davidson family had their tiny cottages. This role endeared him to the whalers and led to the idea that he was “leader of the pack,” although such a role was more likely taken by a little known female (as is typical among killer whales). </span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;After the harpooning, some of the killer whales would even grab the ropes in their teeth and aid the whalers in hauling. The skeleton of Old Tom is on display at the Eden Killer Whale Museum, and significant wear marks still exist on his teeth from repeatedly grabbing fast-moving ropes.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;In return for their help, the whalers would anchor the carcass overnight[4] while the killer whales ate the tongue and lips of the whale, then haul it ashore. The arrangement is a rare example of mutualism between humans and killer whales. The arrangement was called &quot;the law of the tongue&quot;. The killer whales would also feed on the many fish and birds that would show up to pick at the smaller scraps and runoff from the fishing.</span>",Skeleton of Old Tom,.jpg,3008.0,2000.0,125.0,83.0,1611956314920.0,1611956314,e5CqBYSCIQxXc4siRm+yTQ==,1491909.0,3664813,,,,,,,3664813,,an

The Logans were the Davidsons&#039; closest neighbours and the White Heather was often used to tow whales and whaleboats back to the whaling station after a kill. Old Tom had earlier forced a small whale to the surface, where Davidson&#039;s crew had harpooned it. Because he believed the buoyed carcass would be lost to an approaching storm, Logan attempted to bring the carcass ashore without Old Tom eating the tongue and lips.Old Tom apparently grabbed the tow rope in his mouth and lost some teeth in the struggle, with Brooks recounting that Logan said &quot;Oh God, what have I done?&quot; when he realised that Old Tom had lost teeth.[1]</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;When Old Tom&#039;s corpse washed ashore in 1930, the mouth had abscesses from missing teeth and he may have died of starvation.[1][3][6] His death was reported in the 18 September 1930 issue of The Sydney Morning Herald as &quot;King of the Killers&quot;.[1]</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Killer whales became less common in the area after Old Tom died.

Most mammals (some bats and primates, including humans being the exception) have very limited colour vision which is why e.g. a tiger&#039;s camouflaged works. To us it&#039;s bright orange and contrasts heavily against grass and leaves, but to the deer it&#039;s hunting they look the same. As a result, in a Mesozoic world of dinosaurs hunting dinosaurs with much better colour vision, you probably wouldn&#039;t see many animals with tiger-like camouflage (or foxes, orangutans, etc).<br><br>Furthermore, many birds and reptiles actually have even better colourvision than us humans and the rest of the &quot;good&quot; mammals. For example ravens just look black to us but are actually fairly colourful to other birds. Dinosaurs could be similar.",,,,,,,,1612741397,,,3664813,,,,,,,3664813,,an

We have a database of cat blood donors, who are screened for healthiness and to make sure that their blood matches your cat&#039;s blood. Generally, most blood donor animals are employees of the vet clinic, so that way when we need (whole) blood, we can get it quickly. However, things like packed red blood cells are not as easily as accessible and we generally have to order those from companies. Our clinic just got ONE order of dog packed red blood cells; it is literally liquid gold right now. I don&#039;t know what type of blood product your cat received (probably whole blood), but be glad she was able to receive a transfusion.",,,,,,,,1612676687,,,3674456,,,,,,,3674456,,an

Like Birds only need their skin oils, beak and a bit of water.<br>Bathing them is only needed if they get som dirt onto them that is dangerous to lick off that can&#039;t be brushed off or cut out, otherwise some superficial water to encourage grooming is enough.<br><br>After bathing a cat with good cat shampoo the oils (and therefore bacteria) will hopefully still be there and the mouth bacteria will come back as soon as the cat grooms herself (usually right away to dry). <br>So it really accomplishes nothing but stressing the cats skin and annoying the cat. For fluffy, healthy fur feed food with good oils, whole chicks or mice every now and then and brush every other day.<br><br><a href=""#p3679418"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;3679418</a><br>I wouldn&#039;t worry much about diarrhea as long as the cat behaves and eats normally and you can get him to drink enough. Just if it is neverending or comming back every few weeks I&#039;d get a stool sample tested for parasites or treat for worms and giardia ans see if it gets better.<br><br>Constipation on the other hand can get dangerous quickly. You can hope this is just due to your chicken experiment but if it doesn&#039;t go back to normal in the next days with the usual food (if this is dry food pay extra attention on hydration!) not letting a vet rule out at least blockades is a risky gamble.",,,,,,,,1612859026,,,3674456,,,,,,,3674456,,an

So I set my auto cat feeder to feed him at 3 AM, because previously I set it at 4 AM so he would stop waking me at 5:30-6 to feed him. That&#039;s the whole reason I got this feeder in the first place.<br><br>Well tonight, I STILL got woken up at around 3:15, and now I&#039;m wide awake and pissed off.

This is specifically the pork tapeworm, which can use humans as a definitive host (larvae mature in GI tract, tapeworm reproduces and produces proglottids/egg sacs that are then expelled in feces) or intermediate host (eggs mature into larvae that migrate to soft tissue like muscle and sometimes brain and encyst there, waiting for the intermediate host to be eaten by a definitive host). Not all tapeworm species are capable of using humans as both definitive and intermediate host, the ones that are are in genus Taenia or Echinococcus. <br><br>If you&#039;re going to be infected by these dudes, you want to be the definitive host, not the intermediate host. Definitive hosts become DH&#039;s by eating the uncooked flesh of infected intermediate hosts that contain the larval cysts. Pork is the favorite IH, though there are others. Intermediate hosts become IH by eating the feces of DH. This is why you don&#039;t eat dog shit, because dogs are a major DH of pork tapeworm. <br><br>This is a general trend we see among helminthic parasites with indirect lifecycles, by the way. DH is usually GI tract and by eating flesh of IH; IH is in the flesh and by eating feces from GI tract of DH. If you eat raw meat and become a DH, you are perpetuating the spread of these guys to IH by your shit.<br><br>Important to note that there are exceptions to the rule; eating meat infected with other parasites can give you some flesh-inhabitating parasites like Toxo or Trichinella.<br><br>Pic related, here&#039;s what cysticercosis looks like in meat. Presumably pork, but I&#039;m not sure. Am told it has the consistency of popcorn when cooked and considered a delicacy in some places.<br><br>The cysts are fluid-filled and MRI contrast loves fluid-filled spaces.

Wood bedding is bad for hammies and smells like pet shop, I use paper bedding which I recomend, they also enjoy burrowing in it more.",,,,,,,,1611827037,,,3666467,,,,,,,3666467,,an

Shouldn&#039;t have gotten him at all then. Also most dogs you see in everyday life are obese, your perception may be skewed but if you are not posting a picture I can&#039;t say for sure. You are not getting him fattened up with shit food, if anything you might fuck his gut up more and cause diarrhea.Try feeding him smaller amounts but more often, spread over the day, that way dogs tend to put on weight. There is also satin balls but that is a last resort and NOT something to feed regularly. A big bag of good quality food isn&#039;t -that- expensive and it will go a long way for one single dog. Maybe cancel bullshit expenses like your netflix so you can buy your dog proper nutrition. If you can&#039;t even afford non-shitty food than definitely find him a new owner. What are you gonna do if he needs emergency surgery?",,,,,,,,1612739575,,,3678323,,,,,,,3678323,,an

There is a peculiar incomplete circular muscle most people dont know about, or dont even notice when they hurry in like they would with a human bitch, but aside from injuries from insufficient size (i won&#039;t tell you the theoretical minimum but i will tell you most huskies are a bit too small) or abrasion injuries from insufficient arousal and lubrication that also occur in human bitches, there&#039;s only one thing you could possibly hurt and only through pure ignorance or rape and it&#039;s that. There are actually two but the first is immediately apparent and besides being &quot;wider&quot;, readily relaxes with stimulation. The second one can be plowed through and sacrificed like the human hymen for probably the same amount of pain but unlike the hymen or a forced entry into your butthole (you should know), with correct entry technique you can avoid this. With time it will relax more readily and remain relaxed for longer. Much like your anus.<br><br>I don&#039;t really know exactly what is function is, maybe to guide the bony pencildick straight to the uterus and away from the urethra. It ultimately relaxes and dilate during copulation and accommodate more girth than it needs to.

Probably where literally everyone else got the idea. Wherever middle eastern ideas go, this sentiment spreads.

Successful strategy for the times, isn&#039;t it? Make some people unhappy to make your entire society bigger, and more fanatically dedicated to eternal growth and conquest. It&#039;s irrelevant to our way of life now. We maintain our empires with 10 guys and a control panel for some silos, not 10,000 guys with spears.

The only logical solution to this is to shoot, poison, trap, drown or run over every outside cat you see, until their owners begin keeping them inside and spaying them. The good behaviour of indoor cats will help usher in and legitimise an era of euthanasia of feral cats and push through laws calling for owners of cats they&#039;re not intending to breed spaying them, in turn raising the status of cats - When you no longer can find a cat on the street and call it your own, but rather have to buy it with actual cash money from a breeder or a shelter (which spays them), it will deter the lackadaisical would-be owners from getting them, and breeds that aren&#039;t very popular right now might experience a resurgence in popularity once awareness is raised about breed cats.<br>It&#039;s going to get a lot, lot, lot, lot, LOT worse before it gets any better.",,,,,,,,1612802020,,,3676885,,,,,,,3676885,,an

Basically, some descendants of Hallu-chan (Nidhogg) survived in a cave under a really unusual big tree (Yggdrasil), it probably mutated or some shit there and when a slave that had lost one of her eyes fell into the cave under the tree (parallel to Odin giving an eye to Mimir on Yggdrasil), the thing attached itself to her and boom, there was the first titan. Her name was Ymir (also a reference to Norse Mythology, the first being, a giant, was called Ymir)<br><br>So, even though we&#039;re memeing a lot, I really liked the fact that he gave multiple explanations to the origin of titans and really going far with all of them. We believed in science, we believed in demons, for a moment we thought about aliens, but no, it was just a weird, rare, symbiotic relationship with an weird animal from Earth. I liked it. The timing wasn&#039;t good though, /a/ was memeing this shit to hell for the past months and most of the other things in the story aside from this have been consistently shit for the past 14 chapters.

For comparison, the largest recorded Kodiak Brown Bear in the wild weighed 1,656 pounds.

The bear is taller and can run faster than the crocodile, meaning the crocodile can&#039;t abuse its weight advantage by pinning the bear or getting up on his back.

Even if the croc gets a really good chomp on the bear&#039;s leg, he can&#039;t really make the most of that grab without a body of water.
