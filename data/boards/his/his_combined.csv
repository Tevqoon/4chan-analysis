In decades of observations at Gombe National Park in Tanzania, Jane Goodall observed two chimps, probably brothers, who had white sclerae. A third, female chimp developed white sclerae as an adult. But the trait has not spread or reappeared in that population. The advantage of the white sclerae must be related to something that ancient humans did commonly and chimps don’t do or do rarely. Although chimps hunt small prey, often cooperatively, meat makes up less than 2 percent of their diet, whereas Paleolithic humans hunted much larger game that apparently provided a significant part of their diet. Obviously, silent communication among humans would be advantageous for hunting in groups.</span>",201244125249002-2012-05MargShipmanFD,.jpg,424.0,500.0,106.0,125.0,1612923936013.0,1612923936,/eWyqKfAcaDQxqCY6ybCJA==,74420.0,10420431,,,,,,,,10420431,,,,his

Really depends which way you&#039;re looking at it from, if you favor using feet and hands as a diagnostic for phylogeny then floresiensis is descended from habilis/rudolfensis or something like them. If you favor using teeth as a diagnostic for determining the relationship between taxons, then erectus would be your best bet as the ancestor. Whether or not it&#039;s a tall long limbed form of erectus like Turkana boy or short limbed form of erectus like Dmanisi was the ancestor of floresiensis is up for debate. Though the fact that the populations ancestral to late Pleistocene floresiensis were even smaller than their descendants lends more credence to the latter hypothesis being true.<br>Sources: https://repository.si.edu/bitstream<wbr>/handle/10088/6090/Tocheri_2007the_<wbr>primitive_wrist_of.pdf<br>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2<wbr>009Natur.459...81J<br>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ar<wbr>ticles/PMC4651360/",,,,,,,,1612926159,,,10420431,,,,,,,,10420431,,,,his

We were sufficiently near to land to see objects clearly with a glass of twelve magnifications. There was a sloping beach with light bush above upon which several dozen baboons where hunting for and picking up shell fish of crabs, to judge by their movements. Two pure white baboons were amongst them. These are very rare but I had heard of them previously. As we watched, two little brown men walked together out of the bush and down amongst the baboons. They were certainly not any known monkey and yet they must have been akin or they would have disturbed the baboons. They were too far away to be seen in great detail, but these small human-like animals were probably between four and five feet tall, quite upright and graceful in figure. At the time I was thrilled as they were quite evidently no beast of which I had heard or read. Later a friend and big game hunter told me he was in Portuguese East Africa with his wife and three other hunters, and saw mother, father and child, of apparently similar animal species, walk across the further side of a bush clearing. The natives loudly forbade him to shoot.</span><br><br>If they were australopithecines, I don&#039;t think they would be described as gracile when moving, unless australopithecines somehow continued to evolve to be even better adapted to bipedalism. Regardless, the fact that they were described as russet or brown furred is really interesting, as African apes like chimpanzees and gorillas almost all have black fur.

We know for a fact that the laws of physics did not apply at the begining of the universe, since matter can&#039;t appear out of nothing. So there was a state of non-logic before the universe, that was replace by a state of logic. That logic seems to apply universally regardless of circumstances, so it is, in a way, obeying itself. Conciousness then appears and begins to react, interact and follow that same logic, and a &quot;will&quot; to exist emerges in all things. That is, logic itself.

The emotional way an American expresses himself, especially the way he laughs, can best be studied in the illustrated supplements of the American papers; the inimitable Teddy Roosevelt laugh is found in its primordial form in the American Negro. The peculiar walk with loose joints, or the swinging of the hips so frequently observed in Americans, also comes from the Negro. American music draws its main inspiration from the Negro, and so does the dance. The expression of religious feeling, the revival meetings, the Holy Rollers and other abnormalities are strongly influenced by the Negro. The vivacity of the average American, which shows itself not only at baseball games but quite particularly in his extraordinary love of talking – the ceaseless gabble of American papers is an eloquent example of this – is scarcely to be derived from his Germanic forefathers, but is far more like the chattering of a Negro village. The almost total lack of privacy and the all-devouring mass sociability remind one of primitive life in open huts, where there is complete identity with all members of the tribe.</span>",,,,,,,,1613012563,,,10433507,,,,,,,,10433507,,,,his

They accept what the pope says, going against Church tradition<br>2. They don&#039;t accept what the pope says, but if more and more successor pope say the same thing (establishing a tradition, if you will) that will become more and more difficult.

In order to recalibrate the relationship between man and state, the CCP has to resort to legal measures. Besides social harmony, the social credit system also limits the scope of acceptable political discourse, which in turns strengthens the CCP’s grip on power. Since stability and economic growth can only be achieved through political continuity in China, it’s not surprising that they would be willing to go as far as to intervene into the intimate aspects of private individuals. It’s actually quite interesting that Xi and many other Chinese intellectuals are now placing an emphasis on traditional values, I think it will help strengthen their mandate and ability to govern the country by making the population more subservient or obedient. China has no concept of individual rights, something which is so cherished in the West. So it is difficult for the West to understand why so many Chinese are willing to sacrifice some of their freedoms for the greater “good”. But political differences I think shouldn’t be a point of contention between China and the West. Instead of worrying about how they treat their own citizens, our leaders should focus on ensuring access to Chinese markets instead of criticizing them with the goal of scoring some cheap political points.",,,,,,,,1612935147,,,10426066,,,,,,,,10426066,,,,his

But it also entails a certain level of disorder that is intolerable in China. By emphasizing the collective instead of the individual, the Chinaman is on average, more disciplined and obedient than his Western counterpart. By putting the state before the individual, the government is more likely to achieve its goals. Take the pandemic for example, mask ordinances in Asia are followed by mostly everyone which in turn has helped stunt the spread of the virus. Something like masks wouldn’t be a political issue in Confucianist countries like China, South Korea and Singapore. It is an issue in the West though because people don’t like being told what to do, and it’s entirely understandable, they don’t like masks and they have doubts of the efficacy. But as a result of this, there has been more deaths. The bottom line is this, the West will never understand China and China will never understand the West. They are two completely distinct civilizations with conflicting norms and values. They can coexist together in an international order, because in the end of the day, it is only money that really matters. Both greatly benefit from access to each others’ markets and it will continue to be that way in the foreseeable future.",,,,,,,,1612936200,,,10426066,,,,,,,,10426066,,,,his

For instance, it is bribing and threatening people to turn against their neighbors who might be critical of a government doing what I just now described.",,,,,,,,1612988642,,,10426066,,,,,,,,10426066,,,,his

Germany&#039;s entire geostrategic position in WW1 was different than in WW2, and it was neither as reliant upon, nor geared to deliver, rapid knockout blows.

I think the CIA and FBI (not the entirety of the federal government) are organizations that have grown into monsters that keep secrets from other members of government that they have no right to keep secret. The chief counsel of the committee later said:<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;...I no longer believe that we were able to conduct an appropriate investigation of the [Central Intelligence] Agency and its relationship to Oswald.... We now know that the Agency withheld from the Warren Commission the CIA–Mafia plots to kill Castro. Had the commission known of the plots, it would have followed a different path in its investigation. The Agency unilaterally deprived the commission of a chance to obtain the full truth, which will now never be known. Significantly, the Warren Commission&#039;s conclusion that the agencies of the government co-operated with it is, in retrospect, not the truth. We also now know that the Agency set up a process that could only have been designed to frustrate the ability of the committee in 1976–79 to obtain any information that might adversely affect the Agency. Many have told me that the culture of the Agency is one of prevarication and dissimulation and that you cannot trust it or its people. Period. End of story. I am now in that camp.</span>",,,,,,,,1612988884,,,10427250,,,,,,,,10427250,,,,his

There was no sense of a violation of monotheism since either figure was indeed Yahweh. There was no second distinct god running the affairs of the cosmos. During the Second Temple period, Jewish theologians and writers speculated on an identity for the second Yahweh. Guesses ranged from divinized humans from the stories of the Hebrew Bible to exalted angels. These speculations were not considered unorthodox. That acceptance changed when certain Jews, the early Christians, connected Jesus with this orthodox Jewish idea. This explains why these Jews, the first converts to following Jesus the Christ, could simultaneously worship the God of Israel and Jesus, and yet refuse to acknowledge any other god. Jesus was the incarnate second Yahweh. In response, as Segal’s work demonstrated, Judaism pronounced the two powers teaching a heresy sometime in the second century A.D.</span><br><br>http://twopowersinheaven.com/",,,,,,,,1613002666,,,10427250,,,,,,,,10427250,,,,his

For instance, in a contemporary review of Sutton&#039;s Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, researcher Virgil D. Medlin of Oklahoma City University reported finding numerous factual errors in the book and claimed that Sutton repeated &quot;unsubstantiated allegations [and came to] unwarranted conclusions.&quot; Medlin also stated Sutton made use of dubious sources, such as rumor and uncorroborated inquiries, as &quot;documentary proof of [his] allegations.&quot;[13] Similarly, Howard Dickman of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research referred to Sutton&#039;s Wall Street and FDR as a &quot;weak specimen of conspiracy history&quot; that was &quot;poorly written and edited, digressive, repetitious, disorganized, and unconvincing.&quot;[14]</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Sutton&#039;s Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development, 1945 to 1965 has also received criticism, specifically in regards to its thesis. Dr. Samuel Lieberstein of Temple University had initially praised the first two volumes of the study but later came to criticize it in his review of the third volume, stating that Sutton failed to note instances of Soviet technological innovation and ignored positive aspects of the USSR&#039;s planned economy that seemed to conflict with his thesis.[15] British historian Richard C. Thurlow also criticized Sutton&#039;s thesis stating that &quot;all nations were dependent on international trade for economic development and their industrial infrastructure, including the United States&quot; adding that Sutton &quot;totally [disregarded] alternative explanations of Soviet industrialization&quot;.[16]</span>",,,,,,,,1612977549,,,10429772,,,,,,,,10429772,,,,his

I don&#039;t have many physical books that I can sit down and read very often and the selection online for audiobooks at my local library is pretty bad.

This is how they act: the one that must stay underneath lies on her back, stretches out one leg and bends the other while leaning slightly to the side, therefore offering her opening (vagina) wide open: meanwhile, the other lodges her bent leg in her groin, puts the lips of her vagina between the lips that are offered for her, and begins to rub the vagina of her companion in an up and down, and down and up, movement that jerks the whole. This process is dubbed &quot;the saffron massage&quot; because this is precisely how one grinds saffron on the cloth when dyeing it. The operation must focus each time on one lip in particular, the right one for example, and then the other: the woman will then slightly change position in order to apply better friction to the left lip ... and she does not stop acting in this manner until her desires and those of her partner are fulfilled. I assure you that it is absolutely useless to try to press the two lips together at the same time, because the area from which pleasure comes would then not be exposed. Finally, let us note that in this game the two partners may be aided by a little willow oil, scented with musk.&quot; - Al-Tifashi, Nuzhat al-albab,",Erotica,.jpg,1052.0,1052.0,125.0,125.0,1612875068988.0,1612875068,Uq54xRolDYth6hARDlOmsg==,389337.0,10416098,,,,,,,,10416098,,,,his

The author narrates the colonization of eastern North America from the founding of Jamestown until the fall of Quebec (roughly 1580-1760) by telling the tale of a central citizen from 12 different settlements.

This style of hat was used by Mongolian and other steppe noble women, especially the Khatun, to show off their wealth and power. The richer the lady was, the more ornate the hat was expected to be, because who would want to be the richest lady with the worst hat? Since these objects were worn by noble women, and they were expensive and prized, they would also be used as gifts just as a sable coat would be. Of course, the rich people could afford to buy rare jewels and other expensive objects because the Mongolian conquests of such a vast region made transportation of these objects along the silk road possible.<br><br>William of Rubruck writes about it while on his journey in the Mongol world. He states that the hat is made of tree bark, or if they can use a lighter material they will. Rubruck also gives measurements of the hat, which is about half a foot in width, and at least 1.5ft in height.1 Rubruck goes into a good amount of detail regarding how the hat is composed. The hat is hollow, because otherwise it would be even more cumbersome to wear, there are peacock and other fowl’s feathers on top of the square part of the hat (which add yet another 1.5ft or more in height), the shaft of the hat is decorated with stones and other precious materials and had a fur hood that the shaft was attached to.2 While donning the hat, unless they were bald, the ladies would have to tie their hair into a knot so the bocca hat could be tied around the throat with the chin strap.3",bocca3,.jpg,3024.0,4032.0,93.0,125.0,1612945567878.0,1612945567,8fN7LneAtcIUk5tBvcGLow==,1100608.0,10416098,,,,,,,,10416098,,,,his

Marco Polo was so impressed with the hats that he brought one back to Venice. According to the Travels of Chang Chun, “They are always in fear that somebody might inadvertently run against this cap. Therefore, when entering a tent, they are accustomed to go backward, inclining their heads.”4 Another observer is Carpini, and he states that, “The cap as well as this object is covered with buckram, velvet, or brocade, and without this headgear they never go into the presence of men and by it they are distinguished from other women.&quot;5 By the time of Timur, the hat was still in style and even more ornate. Clavijo visited the Timur’s court and noted that Timur’s wife was wearing a bocca and said, “In the back part this crest was very lofty and it was ornamented with many great round pearls all of good orient, also with precious stones such as balas rubies and turquoises, the same very finely set.”6<br><br>1.

But migrant labor probably played a big role. The highest HIV rate countries in the world are South Africa and some of its immediate neighbors- Eswatini, Lesotho, and Botswana. Those 3 countries have a big portion of their adult male populations going to South Africa to work. Within South Africa a lot of blacks used to be forced to live on Bantustans, but had to work in &quot;white&quot; areas (cause Bantustans had no jobs and were too crowded for everyone to support themselves by farming). So even within SA, there was lots of migrant labor. <br><br>Migrant laborers, like truckers, sailors, soldiers, etc. tend to fuck lots of randos or have relationships with multiple mistresses cause they spend a lot of time away from any wives or girlfriends they may have back home. When such a big percentage of the male population are migrant laborers, it creates conditions favorable to the spread of STDs. In Eswatini, for example, the population actually dropped between the 1990s and 2000s, despite a high birth rate. That was probably cause so many men were going to work in SA.",,,,,,,,1613000731,,,10430942,,,,,,,,10430942,,,,his

Most major Mesoamerican civilizations had some sort of written script, and we know that some cities had large libraries: Tenochtitan and Texcoco, the two most powerful Aztec cities, both had large collections of books of tax and adminstrative records, political genealogies and animistic records/historical texts, and religious documents, maybe other kinds beyond these. We have less then 20 surviving Prehispanic texts: Everything from those libraries was burned, Diego De Landa burned likely hundreds, maybe thousands of Maya books, and likewise there were probably hundreds or thousands of Mixtec, Zapotec, etc and other texts lost too.From the 8 Mixtec books that survive, we have a through political history of the areas they cover going back 800 years. It&#039;s sort of insane to think about the amount of records we would have if we had 50, 100, or 500 surviving prehsiapnic books instead of the dozen and half we do. <br><br>In some respects, we basically lost an entire third pillar of human civilization and history alongside the West and East. I&#039;ve seen it said that the burnings are why Mesoamerica is an archaeological rather then a historical topic. The entire conception of world history and how it&#039;s taught could be radically different if we had more surviving texts. If Mesoamerican culture itself survived and continued, then it&#039;d probably get talked about as much as Greece/Rome or China/Japan is, and would get a ton of usage in general pop culture (imagine Aztec culture being used just as much in games and film as Japanese, Mexico still with active, kept up pyramids and palaces tourists could go inside, etc) and in education.<br><br>1/?","The Spanish burning Aztec books, Codex Tlaxcala",.jpg,600.0,624.0,120.0,125.0,1612929468705.0,1612929468,Hm8rK0FIEvKTqyBIhrTRQg==,155573.0,10420510,,,,,,,,10420510,,,,his

Spain wasn&#039;t particularly invested in mass scale colonization as we think of it intially. It was the success of Cortes&#039;s expedition being so lucrative, with tons of wealth and riches found, many former Aztec subject states now sending taxes/tribute to Spain, the establishment of New Spain/Mexico city giving them a base of operations, and having establishjed infanstructure and manpower from the former Aztec Empire and their subject armies made further campaigns be both viable and worth the effort to pursue it. <br><br>Had Cortes failed (and he so, so so nearly did so many times), then it&#039;s possible Spain never gets that push into fully commiting to mass, rapid campaigns; never seeing it as worth the effort: Even when relying on allied armies and the native population being decimated historically, it still took them decades, in some places centuries to conquer it. Doing so without those allies would be a ton of work, when they could invade Africa or the Near East for less effort for more garunteed returns. Diseases were also only as bad as they were historically because. Spain was able to make large headway early on, with a sustained occupation and further campaigns causing REPEATED outbreaks, exacerbated by the political instability, drop in sanitation standards, etc. Without that they won&#039;t be as bad and the longer Spain waits, the more time for disease resistance to build. <br><br>Obvously it&#039;s not like the Americas escapes colonization entirely, but you&#039;d probably see lesser population losses, and more reliance indirect colonialism more in line with what happened in India and Southeast Asia, with existing states and socities kept intact, but suffering East India Company esque shenanigans. <br><br>See my writups in desuarchive.org/his/thread/10338647<wbr>/#10341324 for more detail on all of these points.<br><br>3/?","Conquistadors and Tlaxcalatec forces conquer Michoacan and the Purepecha Empire, Lienzo De Tlaxcala",.jpg,3845.0,3359.0,125.0,109.0,1612929805514.0,1612929805,2fLTG8ZfJNJBLJcRiiXFag==,2348049.0,10420510,,,,,,,,10420510,,,,his

Someone dying in a war or being executed for violating a law is a completely different type of evil. This is my whole point. There were not set and consistent systems of laws, rights, etc. It was a Hobbesian war of all against all, the stronger doing whatever they wished to the weaker. It was hellish. <br><br>In Europe all you had to do was not form your own religious sect and not violate fairly simple laws and you would be fine. This is what we call civilization, where we impose order on chaos. The Mexican system more closely resembled the law of the jungle where predation was arbitrary and based on the whims of the strong. This is why the Spanish had such a hard time dealing with the Mexicans, and could only do so after they had defeated them in battle. They just would not listen to reason, diplomacy, etc and would try to kill them, and only after the Spanish beat them back would they then cooperate. <br><br>The cruel cultural practices were just one artifact of the barbarity of the culture. Which is why trying to make comparisons to things the Europeans did doesn&#039;t work. Cannibalism and sacrifice are not comparable to war and inquisition even if both involve death. One is disorder and random evil, the other is a function of order. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The researcher who proposed that they committed cannibalism for protein intake, Harner, made a ton of errors, such as overlooking tons of protein sources in the Mesoamerican diet, like Nixtamalized maize, chia, amaranth, insects,etc. </span><br><br>How very convenient that politically correct 20th century researchers decided that cannibalism actually wasn&#039;t a thing whereas the people who were there noticed it was frequent enough to have human flesh for sale at markets.

Then keep a close eye on Hideyoshi and Ieyasu for it&#039;s unlikely Mitsuhide acted alone. Keep Hideyoshi occupied fighting a defensive war against the Mori and send more trusted retainers like Shibata Katsuie there too. Then campaign with Ieyasu and my other generals to pacify provinces and conquer North Honshu before continuing south to aid Hideyoshi.<br>Honestly, in hindsight it seems like Nobunaga did a lot right. It&#039;s only the issues with immediate subordinates that led to his downfall. Nobunaga strikes me as someone who had a million and one plans to topple rival daimyo yet couldn&#039;t envision his retainers as having their own agency. <br>I wouldn&#039;t convert as not to raise the suspicions of more zealous buddhists and the kuge, yet I&#039;ll also ease restrictions on the practice of Christianity and make gestures of acceptance toward Christian Samurai in the Western Provinces, especially Otomo Sorin and Omura Sumitada as a means of destabilizing Kyushu and creating a thorn in the Mori Clan&#039;s South. <br>Not sure what would be the best foreign policy. Probably wouldn&#039;t engage in military adventurism like Hideyoshi until things are settled domestically. I&#039;d maybe export Japanese matchlocks and weaponry to Manchus and Jurchens in exchange for diplomatic compliance to terrorize Korea and the Northern Ming. Perhaps the same could be done in Southeast Asia to occupy the Ming armies there as well as being done in cooperation Iberian colonial authorities. Also focus heavily on developing better maritime technology. Hideyoshi&#039;s fleet was nuked by one Korean admiral. An island empire needs a peerless fleet. Perhaps acquiring wako pirates as sailors and Iberian craftsmen would be necessary for this.",nagashino-games-head,.jpg,1140.0,600.0,125.0,65.0,1612919472975.0,1612919472,6DHTlnEAYal3CFTH+sQGsQ==,337825.0,10426009,,,,,,,,10426009,,,,his

Everywhere associated with IE expansion is associated with fair skin. I don&#039;t give a shit either way, but you are lying and I don&#039;t know why. Certain genes associated with light skin took over Europe in a selective sweep but by all indications the lack of that gene in the Yamnaya did not make them dusky. It&#039;s not only one possible gene that controls for skin pigmentation; different genes control paler skin in East Asians than in Europeans for example and some of the palest East Asians lack that common gene generally associated with paleness. You know this yourself; Uzbeks aren&#039;t black. <br><br>Look at Eastern Iranians isolated in eastern Central Asia like the Pamirs; they are descended from the Fatyanovo culture (Yamnaya-derived) and are pale, many are blue-eyed blonds. They&#039;re not super-pale and certainly many are duskier but it&#039;s telling you chose the Turkic-speaking Uzbeks with higher admixture over the Iranian-speaking groups like the Pashtuns, or better yet the more isolated &amp; previously-mentioned Pamirs. The Kalash are the default people mentioned in contexts like these but they have also undergone a lot of admixture, which pulls them away from their original phenotype.<br><br>They were not twink pixies the color of moonlight but they were not the color of Turkics. I will admit that Uzbeks are not even THAT much darker than Clive, which makes it exceedingly bizarre you&#039;d reject someone like him who otherwise represents the most common Yamnaya phenotype well.

Negroid genes have nothing to do with it, whatsoever. <br><br>The thing regarding Cheddar Man is literally true. For example, East Asians have multiple genes which code for paler skin distinct from what Europeans have, and if East Asians were extinct and the Cheddar Man reconstruction people got their hands on the job of reconstructing them, they would be in the exact same situation with Cheddar Man genetically if all they knew were the modern European genes associated with light skin. If a reconstructed Korean had Cheddar Man&#039;s complexion that&#039;d obviously be ridiculous though. Cheddar Man may have been darker than modern Europeans, he may not have been. In any case, to answer your question, paleness in Europeans is associated with a mutation that I believe occurred in Northern Europe during the Chalcolithic.",,,,,,,,1612949415,,,10428070,,,,,,,,10428070,,,,his

It was incontrovertible evidence that the British government quite simply just didn&#039;t care about them, at all.<br><br>There were always historical grievances, religious arguments and so on that nationalists could use to try and rally Irish people to the cause of independence. But the arguments for moderation and accepting the status quo were always quite strong also. <br><br>A struggle for independence would make an enemy of the most powerful country in the world. A struggle for independence would split the country along sectarian and semi-ethnic lines, as the Protestants of Ulster and the Anglo-Irish would be bound to fight it. Much of Ireland especially the East prospered from trade with the rest of the Empire. And so on.<br><br>And I think it&#039;s easy today for nationalists to pretend that those supporting the connection with Britain were only the Protestants and a handful of cringing &quot;jackeens&quot;, but this was hardly the case. We only need look at Scotland today to realize what the attitude of a large minority was, again particularly in the East of the country. Especially after Emancipation, a very, very large proportion of the country was willing to think: Sure there&#039;s been a lot of trouble and suffering over the years, but we&#039;re in it together now, let&#039;s make the best of it.<br><br>But what actually happened in the Famine exposed a terrible truth: that at the time of greatest need, the British showed no pity, at all. They could have used their influence over the landlords of the West to force them to show mercy, they could have temporarily imposed emergency measures to stop evictions and this could have been done as a show of national solidarity at a time of need. But they didn&#039;t. They allowed men and women to be forced, forced onto the cold hard road to walk away, towards nothing and no-one willing to help them, to starve and die with the burning ruins of their house behind them.

That said, they didn&#039;t do enough. If hundreds of thousands of people were starving in London or Manchester, they&#039;d have moved quickly to really help them, but they didn&#039;t do the same for the Irish in the West. Even giving every concession for the fact that it was a remote part of the UK and they may not have realized initially how bad it was, it&#039;s hard to avoid the conclusion that on the whole, the problem just wasn&#039;t taken as seriously as it could have or should have.<br><br>And the people who should have been sounding the alarm at Westminster, the landlords of the West, were mostly thinking about the money they were going to lose because of their tenants not paying rent, not the fact that they were starving and dying. That&#039;s why, sad as it is that so many of the Big Houses were burn down in the 1920s, you can&#039;t help but somewhat understand why it happened.<br><br>I&#039;ll be perfectly honest, in general I have a sneaking admiration for the Anglo-Irish. Ireland&#039;s most distinguished sons and daughters were disproportionately born to this class of people who are of wholly English descent, and even if they were in a privileged position that helped them accomplish what they did, I can understand their pride, and their conflicted feelings towards the independence movement. I have them myself.<br><br>But the Famine was a really grave moral failing on their part. I don&#039;t think they deserve to have it held over their heads forever, but the fact that it is remembered with some bitterness is entirely understandable.

I have held that this is unjustified by the evidence. Examples include Irving&#039;s portrayal of Hitler&#039;s conduct and attitude towards the events of Kristallnacht and the importance attached by Irving to Hitler&#039;s attitude towards the Jewish question as he claims is evidenced by the Schlegelberger note.

Irving has argued, unjustifiably as I have found, that the evidence indicates that Hitler was unaware of any programme for the extermination of Jews at Auschwitz. In his account of the bombing of Dresden Irving (as I have found in section X1 above) persistently exaggerates the number of casualties, so enabling him to make comparisons between the number of civilians killed in Allied bombing raids with the number of Jews killed in the camps.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;In my opinion there is force in the opinion expressed by Evans that all Irving&#039;s historiographical &quot;errors&quot; converge, in the sense that they all tend to exonerate Hitler and to reflect Irving&#039;s partisanship for the Nazi leader. If indeed they were genuine errors or mistakes, one would not expect to find this consistency.

I can quote Richard Evans instead. <br><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt; Irving&#039;s claims to be a historian are bogus for a number of reasons. He has repeatedly condemned other historians for supposedly neglecting or suppressing key documents and for merely plagiarising each other; but how can he possibly do this, when on his own admission he never reads their work, and so can have no idea what is in it? At the Zündel trial in Canada, for example, he was even forced to admit that he had not read the standard work on the extermination of the Jews by Raul Hillberg. How can one take seriously the opinions of such a man on what professional historians do or fail to do? In fact, as we have seen, specialist historians do not merely rely on each other&#039;s work, but base their investigations on research in the archives that is at least as extensive as Irving&#039;s, and in most cases a good deal more rigorous. They cite other historians because other historians have carried out work on archival sources themselves, which it would be otiose to repeat. However, historians always provide precise references to the archival sources on which they base their conclusions, enabling their colleagues to check their accuracy and subject their arguments to critical scrutiny, and this is what commonly occurs when they use each other&#039;s work. By contrast, as we have seen, Irving frequently fails to provide proper source references, is often vague about the documents he claims to have used, and sometimes appears to cover his tracks by making it particularly difficult for his readers to track his sources down.</span><br><br>1/4?",,,,,,,,1613000954,,,10432351,,,,,,,,10432351,,,,his

Examining the views of App, Butz, Faurisson, Rassinier, Staeglich, Christophersen and others quoted and summarized in this paper, it is clear that many of them have been taken over completely by Irving without acknowledgment and presented as his own. Thus his argument that Zyklon-B was only used for delousing and hygiene - for saving lives rather than taking them, in other words - was put much earlier by Butz. So too was his claim that the failure of Yad Vashem to collect six million names showed that six million did not in fact die. Irving&#039;s assertion that Auschwitz was no more than an industrial plant also appears to derive from Butz. His belief that most Jews who died there died of typhus can also be found in Butz&#039;s The Hoax of the Twentieth Century, published long before Irving announced in public his conversion to Holocaust denial. He follows Butz in his semantic disputation of the meaning of terms such as Judentum and Ausrottung. He echoes Austin App in the suggestion that a large number of the Jews who allegedly died in the Holocaust went to Israel and were not killed at all. </span><br><br>2/5",,,,,,,,1613001016,,,10432351,,,,,,,,10432351,,,,his

All that Irving does in this respect is to repeat the arguments that had become standard clichés of this literature in the decades before his conversion. Indeed he himself, writing in his diary on 24th July 1986, admitted that it was Faurisson who first got him &#039;thinking very hard&#039; about the evidence for the Auschwitz gas chambers. There is no evidence that he has carried out any serious research on the Holocaust since the late 1980&#039;s, and none at all that he did any in the run-up to his &#039;conversion&#039; in 1988.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt; The Holocaust denial literature which he has copied is light-years away from the kind of careful, archivally based historical scholarship which Irving has become accustomed to describe as &#039;real history&#039;.

In 1974 &#039;Harwood&#039; published a booklet entitled Did Six Million Really Die? The Truth at Last. In 1978 &#039;Harwood&#039; bought out a second pamphlet, entitled Nuremberg and other War Crimes. Among other things, these brief tracts engaged in the kind of semantic disputes which we subsequently find in the work of Irving. Harwood declared, like Butz, that in his trial at Nuremberg, leading Nazi Alfred Rosenberg &#039;was able to show that &quot;Ausrottung&quot; had been mistranslated; in fact it meant uprooting. </span><br><br>3/5",,,,,,,,1613001078,,,10432351,,,,,,,,10432351,,,,his

The same can be said of Irving&#039;s use of the Goebbels diaries, of which he has made so much in recent years. When Goebbels writes something that fits Irving&#039;s argument, Irving praises it as accurate. When he writes something that does not, Irving suggests, usually without any solid grounds for doing so, that Goebbels had ulterior motives in writing it, and that it cannot be relied on.</span>",,,,,,,,1613001220,,,10432351,,,,,,,,10432351,,,,his

For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to fields from cosmology to seismology, the latter of which has been described as &quot;the Jesuit science&quot;.[165] The Jesuits have been described as &quot;the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century&quot;.[166] According to Jonathan Wright in his book God&#039;s Soldiers, by the eighteenth century the Jesuits had &quot;contributed to the development of pendulum clocks, pantographs, barometers, reflecting telescopes and microscopes – to scientific fields as various as magnetism, optics, and electricity. They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on Jupiter&#039;s surface, the Andromeda nebula, and Saturn&#039;s rings. They theorized about the circulation of the blood (independently of Harvey), the theoretical possibility of flight, the way the moon affected the tides, and the wave-like nature of light.&quot;[167]</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt; The Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Western science and astronomy. One modern historian writes that in late Ming courts, the Jesuits were &quot;regarded as impressive especially for their knowledge of astronomy, calendar-making, mathematics, hydraulics, and geography&quot;.[168] The Society of Jesus introduced, according to Thomas Woods, &quot;a substantial body of scientific knowledge and a vast array of mental tools for understanding the physical universe, including the Euclidean geometry that made planetary motion comprehensible&quot;.</span>",,,,,,,,1613001194,,,10432199,,,,,,,,10432199,,,,his

How do people claiming science as their god not know about this again? It is easy such transition species could have lived down into a bit closer to our times and all 12 Archaic Cultures speak of such entity in their lore. I mean look at what we’ve found on Madagascar among species more from those times still moving about there! What do they teach them in schools these days?

Hence why the saying went: &quot;Where some states have an army, the Prussian Army has a state&quot; (Voltaire). Bismarck understood that military might alone was not enough to accomplish the nation&#039;s goals so he used diplomacy, but he still was militaristic as hell. Reminder that he started a war with Denmark, AH, and France, and that he basically ignored the Reichstag all together and ruled without the will of the people by manipulating Wilhelm the first. Prussia for its entire history was militaristic af. Read &quot;The Iron Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Bismarck, a Life&quot; to see how militaristic it was. Let&#039;s not forget that before WW1 even ended, Germany was under military dictatorship under Ludendorf and Hindenburg. <br>2. Great Britain always had and maintained the largest fleet in the world. Germany started building one greater. Germany also would antagonize GB in every corner on the globe, from the Boer wars to the North African wars. Germany would also constantly try and start wars between GB and other nations, like the US when a German diplomat tried to convince the American government that Japan (backed and assured by GB) was going to attack the US from Mexico, and that Germany will support the US if England got involved. GB tried to avoid conflict with them and attempted an alliance, only to get rejected. So it was clear to British politicians that Germany wanted war. Which led GB to join the Entente. <br>3. Germany started WW1.

Mongol influence lasted in all of those regions up until modernity. The absolute height of Indian power and culture was under a mongol offshoot dynasty. In Persia the Illkhanate and Timurid empire would shape turko-Persianite culture through direct mongol influence or influence from the far east that came easily through the mongol empire. Central Asians were still only legitimate rulers if they could trace their lineage to genghis all the way until the Uzbeck Khanate was conquered by the russians in the 19th century. Russian culture is a mix of Kieven rus-byzantine orthodox-and eastern mongol influences. I can go on.

I am going to answer OP&#039;s question. Eritrea has been a separate kingdom from Ethiopia for hundreds of years, called Medri Bahri. The Italians absorbed most of this kingdom since the Eritreans saw Italians as allies to fight against the Ethiopians. After colonization was over, Eritrea was its own autonomous country in coalition with Ethiopia. The Ethiopian king Haile Selassie broke this federation and forcefully annexed Eritrea in 1962. The movement for Eritrean independence started after this. It ended up being a full-scale war after the communist Derg massacred Eritrean villages and caused a famine that affected millions of people. Eritrea successfully won this war of independence after winning the Battle of Afabet and the Derg was on its last legs after the collapses of the Eastern Bloc. Since the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia hasn&#039;t been properly demarcated a border war ensued and Ethiopia has been occupying Eritrean land till this day. Recently, the president Isais Afwerki has started supporting Abi Ahmeds new administration in order to disempower their perceived enemies: The tigrayans.",,,,,,,,1612914436,,,10422056,,,,,,,,10422056,,,,his

Did he not act improperly, even cowardly?’ In view of this account, why would God inspire Peter to call Lot a “righteous man”? Did Lot act with God’s approval? (2 Peter 2:7, 8) Let us reason on this matter so that we do not draw the wrong conclusion.<br>To begin with, it should be noted that rather than condoning or condemning Lot’s actions, the Bible simply reports what took place. The Bible also does not tell us what Lot was thinking or what motivated him to act as he did. When he comes back in the “resurrection of . . . the righteous,” perhaps he will reveal the details.—Acts 24:15.",,,,,,,,1612969530,,,10429804,,,,,,,,10429804,,,,his
