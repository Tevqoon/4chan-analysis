0,23675577,1.0,1.0,10/24/15(Sat)16:57:43,Anonymous,Welcome to /r9k/,"/r9k/ is an imageboard where there are no exact reposts.<br><br>

1. If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily.<br>
2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression.<br>
3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, 
your mute time doubles each time you fuck up.<br>
4. Backlinks, eg <span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;1</span>, are not viewed by the robot. So &quot;lolwut&quot; and &quot;<span class=""deadlink"">&gt;&gt;2</span> lolwut&quot; are the same post, in the 
eyes of the robot.<br>
5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please).<br>
6. Images are <b>NOT</b> included in the filter, only text. <br>
7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time.<br>
8. You cannot post a picture without text.<br>
9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc).<br>
10. Posts require a certain minimum amount of original content in order to be posted.<br>
11. Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely.<br>
12. The original algorithm was designed by XKCD:<br>

It sounds like you want to date, but are worried about doing something down the line that will make her reject you or break up with you on her terms. What you&#039;re doing now is trying to maintain control of the situation by ending it on your terms to protect your ego. What I suggest is to find a source of validation for yourself that doesn&#039;t stem from the approval of others, especially women. You need a way to tell yourself &quot;you know what? Fuck what these bitches think, I&#039;m living for myself&quot; and believe it. What I suggest doing is something that challenges your anxiety, and conquer it. Everyone has some form of anxiety and self doubt, but the people who have it figured out have a way to drown out the voice of self doubt with a greater voice of self approval, and positive reinforcement. If you can, you should repeat the phrase to yourself &quot;I&#039;m pretty fuckin cool, and I&#039;m probably overthinking this interaction&quot; as a reminder to yourself. This should be done on top of doing things that give you validation as a man, conquering goals such as creative, athletic, or interpersonal ones help you get that voice of approval in your head. The opinions of others mean nothing in the long run, what&#039;s going on in your head does.

I assumed this would look more intimidating but it&#039;s actually somewhat inspirational since not a single one of these women are attractive to me, at least not enough to be debilitating (bottom left is homely cute). General anxieties aside, I&#039;d be more intimidated by the dudes since they&#039;re still competition no matter the state of the room, similar to how I suspect girls feel about other girls. But overall this looks very doable. Biggest worries would be having a good backdrop, optimal angle, not accidentally doing anything stupid just because I&#039;m home, and praying my pc doesn&#039;t turn against me and start playing hentai ASMR for some sadistic reason.<br>I still hate this though. Many subjects are probably easier than ever right now but online takes the social aspect out of it almost entirely (unless there&#039;s some equivalent to a virtual campus everyone hangs out at that I&#039;m not aware of). It might sound silly but the chance to meet a good young woman is the main reason I want to go to school. Fixing my life sounds great too but there&#039;s no other cluster zones of that population after high school. Clubs are for skanks and workplace is too few fish typically. Tinder can fuck off too but that&#039;s obvious.<br>Anyway thanks for the whitepill OP, the worst part about it is the realization that so many girls are ugly and the ones I&#039;d want definitely have boyfriends if this is their competition.",,,,,,,,1613037480,,,62276704,,,,,,,62276704,,,,,,,r9k

All he does is lazily watch YouTube videos to &quot;react&quot; to or lazily play whatever flavor of the month ever other streamer is playing just for views. His takes continue the lazy trend by being lethargic drivel that tries to portray him as &quot;above it all&quot;, but only show how little depth his &quot;offensive&quot; comedy has. Even his camera set-up is the laziest thing he could throw together since years ago, and he hasn&#039;t been assed to change it since. All of this doesn&#039;t stop his videos from getting millions of views, and his streams above 10k viewers, which is probably more of a reflection of how stupid the normie community is if this lazy manbaby can pull all this fame off while putting in the absolute smallest amount of effort possible to even create a video or run a stream.<br><br>It reminds me of when GameFreak put the smallest budget they could into Sword and Shield because they knew their audience were a bunch of retarded children and manchildren that&#039;ll buy whatever buggy mess they shit out just because it has a Pikachu on the cover, and it easily goes on to become the best selling Pokemon game ever.",,,,,,,,1613063534,,,62280322,,,,,,,62280322,,,,,,,r9k

Circumcision is a multi-million dollar for-profit industry, why else would they amputate perfectly healthy tissue and violate the Hippocratic Oath so blatantly? Men are legally second-class citizens in America, since female circumcision has been banned for decades. We will genuinely never experience how sex is meant to feel, ever, even if we attain a fulfilling relationship, which has become more difficult in all of history due to the sexual revolution (see the study entitled &quot;Your Looks And Your Inbox&quot; conducted by OkCupid where women rate over 80% of men as unattractive.)<br><br>Not only do we have to cope with this, but we never had fathers, or any positive male role model, for our entire childhood. Teachers are 80%+ female until High School. No father, no foreskin, no social support, no career path.

The great masses of a nation are not composed of philosophers. For the masses of the people, especially faith is absolutely the only basis of a moral outlook on life. The various substitutes that have been offered have not shown any results that might warrant us in thinking that they might usefully replace the existing denominations. But if religious teaching and religious faith were once accepted by the broad masses as active forces in their lives, then the absolute authority of the doctrines of faith would be the foundation of all practical effort. There may be a few hundreds of thousands of superior men who can live wisely and intelligently without depending on the general standards that prevail in everyday life, but the millions of others can not do so. Now the place which general custom fills in everyday life corresponds to that of general laws in the State and dogma in religion&#039;.",1474181330972,.jpg,735.0,599.0,125.0,101.0,1613062257109.0,1613062257,P8NVc+qwVdxnG32gtWuY1w==,72740.0,62279400,,,,,,,62279400,,,,,,,r9k

Of course!<br>2. I&#039;d never be able to scratch the surface on that. True love between two is a mystery to a third party outsider<br>3. I think she&#039;s a very good character. She has her flaws. She has her fair share of tragedy (way more than fair share really), she certainly has cute quirks. Also as someone who went to a highschool full of edgy, downtrodden zoomers i understand things like self harm. I&#039;ve seen my fair share with a multitude of people. I hate seeing Ava self harm, but it&#039;s oddly interesting to actually see a character like those i saw in school. She&#039;d fit right in in a weird way<br>4. Anime or TV? Between that I&#039;d say i love Breaking Bad for tv but i have no favorite anime. I don&#039;t actually watch that stuff for the most part. I do watch cartoons though. Hilda and Star Wars The Clone Wars are my favorites. I think she&#039;d like breaking bad for some reason, and certainly Hilda, but i have no idea about anything star wars.<br>5. I assume you mean &quot;plan,&quot; to which i can kinda answer yes and no. I guess i kinda just didn&#039;t care where i went. But i definitely thought of waifuism from a young age.

How are all the girls in the vicinity going to know about your massive dong if you don&#039;t talk to them? Me, and Im not perfect, had a decent personality but have been a disapointment to every sexual partner Ive ever had. My first of 2 one night stands had her laughing at me. Im just under 5&quot; not much girth. All people care about in a relationship is satisfaction, otherwise why would you be together. In the past women had social pressures to keep them in long term relationships. Unfortunately a large part of young female&#039;s (40 and under) satisfaction is in sex. Maybe youll have some happy feelings relationship with someone over the hump, but if ya cant fuck youre an outcast.<br><br>For example, at my recent job I expressed to an older coworker who was married, there was no chance of a sexual relationship to sum it up, that verbatum, &quot;I dont think I could see myself in a relationship at this point in my life. I dont understand women and dont think Id meet their needs.&quot;. Harmless enough. Definitely didnt make women out to be the bad guys. So i walk in the next day to her basically giving a lecture to the younger women about how Im selfish and fucked up. Im not worth being around and will only take from the people around me. Mind you I am the whippong boy at this job running to everybeck and call of my female owners and mostly female cooworkers. I had never crossed the older women. One of the girls I was closer too gave me the inside scoop anout the rest of what she said. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Women are trash. Women will never believe the values you believe. Women will never play fair. Women are useless in comparrison to menbesides their beauty and ability to procreate</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;I cant wait to have a sex robot and a bunch of kids whom never have to suffer through the childish nacisistic succubus that is the modern women.

All i&#039;m gonna say is, small or big, if you believe sex is mostly about penetration, you&#039;ll get rejected by most females aside from the ones that are shallow and have a cavemen mentality, which makes it unsurprising that you &quot;disappoint them&quot; considering how shallow and brainwashed by porn, they are<br>Most women are not like that, but you suck just as much as the shallow ones, so you deserve them. But they have a pussy so they get better men than you while being as shallow as you, while you have a dick so you just don&#039;t get anything. You both suck balls.

Sure, you bed her, what&#039;s she gonna do unless she&#039;s a bitch, but you don&#039;t have her. If a woman isn&#039;t married to you physically she is not in full harmony of love and lust. That is a genuine reason for anyone to be concerned. You don&#039;t have to look at the blackpills in this thread, just look at reality objectively. Once you know something you can only accept it, repress it, pray it goes away, or give yourself brain damage. A woman who has tasted bigger -- hell, a woman who is tipped off by porn, size queen friends, social media, or the feminist zeitgeist -- will always know the other side. The only exceptions to this rule are girls who have not had big dick or have had bad experiences with big dick. What&#039;s the go to cope? &quot;It hurts&quot;, yet a guy who makes love with a big dick can give them the deepest orgasms they never knew existed. This knowledge is honestly dangerous to both romantic love and men&#039;s mental health but I don&#039;t think it can be contained in our current age. Most men literally can&#039;t give them that quality of pleasure without emasculating themselves. Nature gave them buttons only the biggest can press.<br>Here&#039;s another cope:<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;big guys don&#039;t try, small guys put in work</span><br>big guys are the only ones who even have a shot at making them cum from PIV alone. If they learn the small guy&#039;s tricks and give her both she will be over the moon more than most men could ever manage. This isn&#039;t even factoring in the girls who actually like rough womb pounding sex. A big dick will last longer because it doesn&#039;t need to work as hard to get her going whereas everyone smaller is getting closer to cumming with each desperate thrust. Virgins only. I&#039;d rather be alone than cope with being unable to provide for her physically. For any man that is the worst feeling imaginable.",,,,,,,,1613024918,,,62264962,,,,,,,62264962,,,,,,,r9k

If you masturbate, it&#039;s less than ideal, but it won&#039;t kill you. The idea is that addiction to porn is the main problem, not simple masturbation. However, masturbation is used as the road to porn consumption, and so, while not as inherently destructive as porn usage, has the potential to be very bad for you.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;doesn&#039;t go into any specifics on what you should be doing instead</span><br>The book was initially written to help people stop smoking. So what should you be doing instead of smoking? Not smoking! It&#039;s just that simple. A real relationship is definitely good, not just for sexual reasons, but relationships are generally a positive, but, if we keep with the smoking analogy, you don&#039;t need to go out and actively campaign against smoking or replace smoking with another habit to quit. The benefit is quitting smoking, which will improve your life. In that same way, the goal of the book isn&#039;t to go and tell you to get a girlfriend, it&#039;s to get you to end your porn addiction so that you can take control of your life and do what you would with it.",,,,,,,,1613020883,,,62222012,,,,,,,62222012,,,,,,,r9k

It might just be the fandom painting Makima as more hardcore in my eyes but Reze mostly seemed assertive, minus the whole tongue biting part. She doesn&#039;t have the dog trainer association either but who knows what cards she might have kept to her chest. Regardless, the implied glimpse at genuine romantic tendencies puts Reze more in line with slutty high school girlfriend while Makima is a true queen. While both are obviously abusive, I like to think Reze (and maybe Makima too) would have been different outside of the confines of the plot. Upon further reflection though, I&#039;d rather be psychologically broken in service of a goddess than have my tongue bitten off, but I&#039;m choosing to remain ignorant of that dealbreaker.",yes ma&#039;am,.jpg,1222.0,1807.0,84.0,125.0,1613045872408.0,1613045872,fTMi5+OZTOuOMrxA3dLREQ==,433012.0,62266728,,,,,,,62266728,,,,,,,r9k

If it doesn&#039;t bring you suffering then it isn&#039;t depression. Therefore if you can&#039;t figure how to get rid of depression you aren&#039;t a highly intelligent person.

I&#039;m yet to meet a really smart, logical woman.</span><br>I do agree here. Most of them probably are dumber. But even then, I think there are enough smart ones that it&#039;s not unrealistic, even if unlikely, you&#039;d meet one. And as I said in one of the first replies, there are other things she can be better at besides just logical thinking and physical strength that can even out the field, as long as you&#039;re not one of those super-enlightened men.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;it&#039;s just woman having no respect for her man and using him for his money and what not.

If men withheld their love from women that aren&#039;t worthy of it, then, necessarily, women would have to either give up on finding partners or work on themselves and become worthy. Perhaps a lot would choose the former, but surely some more truly dominant women who want to improve themselves so that they can find a man to wash their dishes and whatnot would emerge as well. If my hypothesis here is correct, speaking about this scenario, we can say that there was, from the start, some sort of desire in a segment of the female population that wanted to take the dominant role in the relationship--they just didn&#039;t have to work for it previously because men coddled them too much. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;just pay her</span><br>I&#039;m not into findom.",,,,,,,,1613055341,,,62266728,,,,,,,62266728,,,,,,,r9k

Blank slate from today on, and your focus now should be on what to do in the future. Your past is not a reason to hate yourself, it&#039;s an opportunity to grow and learn from those mistakes. You don&#039;t need your family anymore, but you need you. You&#039;re a man, so you begin to respect other people through their actions, and that&#039;s exactly what you need to start doing for yourself. You should start setting goals for yourself to accomplish, in creative, athletic, and interpersonal aspects. The more you accomplish to yourself, the more you respect yourself. And you have to be open to change and strife. If you really want to see a difference, you have to be willing to want it and work for it.

It was my first semester at uni and I was basically a drug virgin except for drinking and hitting a cart and not feeling (or maybe I did but was too drunk, it was a first for both) it at a prom afterparty. I had smoked weed prior since arriving but didn&#039;t do it too much because I was swamped. I needed energy. So I went straight for the 5 hour energy advanced shots after hating what coffee did to my stomach and it was basically the time of my life. I ended up becoming hypomanic a lot after being entirely overwhelming and depressed by coursework. My mind actually did the primal defense mechanism to finish a dumb draft of a dumb essay for a dumb class that turned out to be the only 3 credits I got from that school. I was up for 3 days and the most social and talkative and happy I ever was in my life. It was how people describe meth with the energy and motivation. But then I&#039;d crash and actually get really depressed and suicidal but take it really seriously because I didn&#039;t know anything about drugs or the brain or coping. But yeah after that I started a thing with weed that hasn&#039;t ended and tried a lot of actual stuff like benzos and psychs. But I have never felt as good as I did on caffeine and mental illness<br><br>I drink coffee every day now and it does nothing for me at all similar to what the 5 hour energy did",1604252955508,.jpg,960.0,960.0,125.0,125.0,1613022571771.0,1613022571,sTNmpaivzjRwT28DpA4Aww==,76515.0,62262584,,,,,,,62262584,,,,,,,r9k

Not many of the things I find interesting could help make the world a better place either... the only one I can really think of is perhaps making a website of some kind that would allow users to interact in a different way from before. I feel like the Internet has so much potential for different ways to interact but for some reason it&#039;s not being explored and everything is either a traditional forum, image board, Reddit-style forum, IRC/Discord chat, or Twitter/Facebook/Instagram type site. That does cover most of the bases but I imagine there might be other ways to interact too, for instance a while ago there was an Anon posting here who made a site to vent your frustrations, can&#039;t remember what it was called anymore but it was a novel concept where you could post a short message and it would appear on the site for everyone to see for a few seconds before disappearing. I think more experimentation like that would be neat to have, though I of course don&#039;t have any good ideas myself, but it&#039;s interesting to me so I like to think about it occasionally, and it&#039;s something that I could feasibly do if I came up with a good concept.",,,,,,,,1612977469,,,62264486,,,,,,,62264486,,,,,,,r9k

At first they keep their distance and think nothing of each other. But then after a few hours the cat begins to hunger. It has only one option for food and Warwick only now realizes his fate. I sit next to the bin on a reclining deck chair and sip a long island ice tea. I listen to the terrifying screams and the horrific yells of agony. I listen to the sounds of the blood thirsty feline, driven insane by the hunger for supple midge meat. It&#039;s such a beautiful sunny day but the sounds of midget flesh tear and rip echoes throughout the trees. His horrific screams are truly that off torturous nightmares that humanity can&#039;t even fathom. I can open to the lid anytime to watch but I never do. I don&#039;t need to. I am satisfied with the sounds of Warwick Davis&#039; death.

Now if they were readily available and affordable besides, crime would drop drastically, prisons wouldn&#039;t be so overcrowded, and there&#039;d be no more need for an endless war on drugs that can never be won. For every ten million in illegal shit that the government and law enforcement stop or sieze and pat themselves on the back for, easily 1000x that gets through. Any siezure by law enforcement is a drop of rain in an ocean.It&#039;s simply a waste of resources that&#039;d be better served in actual communities that need help. If you had the option of going to a pharmacy and picking up some lab certified pharmacueticals or going to do some shooting gallery or seeing some shady fuck to get a fix, which would you do? Money fuels the black market and the violence its creates, remove the snake&#039;s head and it will die. There&#039;s absolutely no reason, with all the given evidence and crime statistics compiled for the last 50 years that most substances should be legal. Fuck, they still sell tobacco products and that stuff is way more deadly. Slap a warning label on your 90% pure lab grade drugs and make them seem boring besides and most people will want nothing to do with them after awhile. Take amsterdam, pot&#039;s legal there, but most locals don&#039;t smoke it because to them it&#039;s boring as shit but tourism booms because foreigners enjoy the novelty of smoking in a pot cafe. <a href=""#p62271980"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;62271980</a> Also this, but worded better.",,,,,,,,1613012260,,,62264486,,,,,,,62264486,,,,,,,r9k

At first you might see a spike in usage because hey, legal, but eventually it would taper off and eventually lower. There&#039;s so many reasons to legalize a lot of stuff and redirect funds elsewhere but everyone, especially politicians, are afraid of this and need to appear &#039;tough on crime&#039; to stay elected, and unfortunately that means the people most at risk suffer for it.
