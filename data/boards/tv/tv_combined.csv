He got caught when he gassed an entire section of a victims house and broke in and molested the kids and when the parents woke up he decided to murder them. Their bodies were missing a long time and the only remains found did t have teeth so they couldn’t check dental records. They found their teeth in his office but it’s suspected he used parts of them for implants in other people.

The CGI backgrounds and sets are awful, too many sets were done in CGI (I don&#039;t really care much for the practical effect vs CGI argument, but the sets are one part of the CGI that are bad, sets shouldn&#039;t all be CG). There are plenty of one note and redundant characters with silly names. These one note characters or aesthetics make it hard to say that these characters were anything more than for merchandise. There is plenty of reactionary film making and relying on nostalgia, which people attack other films for. Adding in characters like Jango Fett and Boba were done as part of this.

Who was Vader&#039;s Antagonist? Sandpeople? Sand? Is this supposed to be an analogy for the chaos of Democracy?

He couldn&#039;t! Nobody could. He should have been that powerful. It would have pushed the stakes up for the OT and explained why Vader did nothing but submit and bide his time. Vader should have been furious at the blindness and the weakness in the Jedi that allowed all of this to happen, it would have put so much more emphasis on the &quot;If you only knew the power of the darkside&quot; and &quot;with our combined strength we can overthrow the emperor&quot;, etc...Instead, at the end of the prequels it&#039;s literally just like he hates the sand people and randomly turns on the Jedi because he has dreams of his wife dying and wants to save her.

When you truly believe that you&#039;re fighting for innocent lives and the other side is a bunch of baby murdering rapist Nazis who take up two parking spaces because they don&#039;t give a single fuck about anyone else to just park like a normal person, then basically even killing them is justified because you&#039;re stopping them from destroying the world because they&#039;re lack any humanity and redeemability like they&#039;re a Captain Planet &quot;I love pollution&quot; villain or something.<br>And to be fair, it&#039;s not one group that does this. Guys like the Pizzagate shooter or that guy that shot up mosques in New Zealand are just as guilty as falling for this mentality. But to be unfair, it&#039;s very clear that the mainstream media is painting only one group as evildoers and basically telling (or in some cases like the video you presented, outright saying) that you should be physically and violently attacking these people. Channels like CNN are calling for blood and getting their demands met. These same people then turn around and criticize Trump for &quot;inciting violence&quot; when they&#039;ve been doing that for the past four years and are continuing to do it.<br>Personally, I just stay out of politics, and I encourage others to. I tell people not to vote and don&#039;t vote myself. Before, it seemed like it&#039;d be a good thing to get everyone involved in politics and voting, but now it&#039;s clear that all that does is destroy communities.

Imagine a younger Romney who rouses the nation to a new war, against India, through power of charisma and speech alone. Then he leave on ship to head the armies conquering India. But then come rumors that Mitt ran a Black Mass Satanist dinner in New York. Also, people awaken one day and find that someone defaced the Holocaust Museum and the Lincoln Memorial... rumors spread that it is Mitt Romney in preparation to overthrow the government. So he is recalled from his command to stand trial. Instead of returning, Mitt runs to Russia where he becomes a major advisor to Putin. Soon though, he finally has to leave in a great hurry when it is discovered he&#039;s been banging Putin&#039;s wife in secret. He runs to China where, again, he miraculously becomes a major political force and advisor, adopting Chinese customs and language with ease. After some time he leaves China and ends up living Afghanistan with the tribesmen as one of them, in one of their mud fortresses where he is finally found by American special forces and he goes out fighting, charging them repeatedly with machine gun in his glorious black-and-gold armor and Dune-look headset. Exactly such, and more was the life of the ancient Alcibiades from Athens. How inconceivable!

You could land a plane on all that excess headroom on Bryce and Bateman&#039;s cards, etc. etc. we could go on for days about minor flaws in each. But Luis&#039;s card is an affront to all notions of taste. Green and gold lettering. Last name first, and in all caps no less. That unnecessary offset between the company name and title. A business card is such a mundane, disposable item, and yet somehow this card is a monument to one man&#039;s blind hubris. Conventions exist for a reason. True, breaking them at the right times for the right reasons can be bold, but flouting all of them at once simply for its own sake comes off as arrogant at best, and desperate and unstable at worst. A business card should be just that: businesslike. The conformity to a general format shows that you understand your profession, and you take it seriously; the standard is such because you are one of the individuals who sets it. The variations in font, texture, and format are small, but deliberate, showing your attention to detail. Luis&#039;s card has none of this subtlety. He stole elements from each of the others, made some loud, obnoxious changes, and then he parades it around as though it&#039;s something to be proud of for being unique. It&#039;s the equivalent of a teenager thinking he&#039;s unique for dressing goth or punk - of course you&#039;re different if you make a deliberate, relentless, and visible effort to be, but it&#039;s a hollow, pointless kind of difference. It&#039;s attention-seeking through artificial construction of a personality.

After they filmed the next episode (Kara finding her body, Dee&#039;s send off), they had to shut down production because of the writer&#039;s strike, so there was a possibility that the strike would take too long and the show would be cancelled. After Revelations aired they said that it could&#039;ve been the last episode, but I&#039;m just saying that&#039;s a little suspect since the one right after was already filmed.<br>Concerning what you said actually, during the strike RDM came up with a different plan for the second half of the season, because he had (for once) planned the whole season out before they started. The mutiny was still there but originally Gaeta would&#039;ve survived and his faction would&#039;ve gone off on their own",,,,,,,,1613014913,,,146402247,,,,,,,,146402247,,,,,,,tv

(Who better to explain the scene than Hughes himself?) In the commentary, Hughes stated that the scene was filmed at the Chicago Art Institute, a museum that was a place of “refuge” for him when he himself was in high school. Hughes remarked, “This was a chance for me to go back into this building and show the paintings that were my favorite.” During the scene, several paintings are shown. Eventually we come to a couple paintings that show a mother and a child. Regarding these paintings, Hughes stated, “This I thought was very relevant to Cameron---the tenderness of a mother and a child which he didn’t have.”",,,,,,,,1613006053,,,146401020,,,,,,,,146401020,,,,,,,tv

The main characters are at exactly the age where they are becoming adults and therefore are beginning to be able to understand the profound parts of life, even though they can&#039;t do so completely yet. So the art they see at the museum is a visual and physical manifestation of that. One minute they&#039;re playing hooky is one last rebellious hurrah of their time in highschool, and then the next they&#039;re confronted with something sublime which they can&#039;t fully grasp but with powerfully draws them in. Coming of age movies are about that transition between childhood and adulthood. The characters are very immature in many ways but they&#039;re clever and resourceful enough to pull off an all-time great school skipping adventure. The museum sequence is pulling them a little towards adulthood and all its complexities, but instead of doing it in a scary or stressful way it&#039;s gentle and beautiful and very comforting.<br>Also I should have posted about Mia Sara in the childhood crush scene, I rememberd Elizabeth Shue but the pool scene in this movie and the movie Legend made quite an impression on me too.",,,,,,,,1613007556,,,146401020,,,,,,,,146401020,,,,,,,tv

Wearing them is sort of saying that you&#039;re wanting to take off quickly and leave, that you don&#039;t value the place enough to spend considerable time there.<br><br>Two: Hats can disguise the face and jackets can conceal the body. Taking them off removes a lot of doubt about your intentions. It&#039;s like how a guy in a hoodie is inherently less trustworthy late at night than a man in a polo. <br><br>Three: In a lot of cultures, saying &quot;sorry&quot; often to your close friends or family is seen as rude, because you&#039;re treating these people that should be intimate relations as though they&#039;re distant. Hats and jackets are a lot like that. Continually wearing them at relation&#039;s home is sending the message that you&#039;re not very comfortable around them, that your relationship is less intimate, etc.",,,,,,,,1613011520,,,146404548,,,,,,,,146404548,,,,,,,tv

I thought their sexual chemistry in the TFA interrogation scene was obvious, and that was probably what hooked a lot of female viewers. Women enjoy erotic fantasies where men - especially bad boys - are in control. The dialog of the scene oozes sensuality with Kylo threatening to just take whatever he wants. Even Rey&#039;s initial attempts to shit test him by asking him to take off his mask just results in him doing so with confidence, putting her off guard. Virgin/beta male viewers probably didn&#039;t really understand what was happening in that moment. It not only humanized him as a villain but revealed him as a love interest and set the tempo for their relationship. They both fear and desire one another in their own respective fashions. <br><br>It&#039;s really the best romance in Star Wars, in my opinion. It seems the most organic and romantic out of all of them. Padme and Anakin is a good romance narrative wise but the execution was a little wonky. It doesn&#039;t help that we have Anakin and Padme meet when he&#039;s like 8 and she&#039;s 25. I guess in the story she&#039;s only like 6 years older than him but on screen it comes across a lot larger. There isn&#039;t really much chemistry between the actors either, even though they are good at their own respective roles and scenes otherwise. Han and Leia are the obvious runners up as the second best romance in the 1-9. The only reason I would rate them second to Reylo is because the characters don&#039;t have a lot to do and the Luke x Leia thing is awkward. Their relationship also falls apart as seen in the ST, so it&#039;s not really a great romance.",kiss,.gif,498.0,245.0,125.0,61.0,1613003328995.0,1613003328,3hfeEHDV2VflJYxs8tuYBw==,4117257.0,146397600,,,,,,,,146397600,,,,,,,tv

There is this weird divide between shorter-than-average and much-shorter-than-average men. <br>Men who range from ~5&#039;5 - 5&#039;8 (in other words, looking at a bell curve, the largest &quot;section&quot; of those below the average, tend to be much more insecure. <br>but there&#039;s a threshold where once you&#039;re under 5&#039;4, unless you grew up in a super macho/toxic setting (remember that short angry guy in the bagel shop video?) you don&#039;t really care as much bc you&#039;re so much shorter than average that your worldview is shifted. <br>I can get it, i think the biggest source of 5&#039;5-5&#039;9 rage comes from the fact that if women find both a 5&#039;6 man and a 5&#039;11 man attractive, they&#039;ll probably choose the taller one. But the thing is, if you&#039;re under 5&#039;4 and a woman is attracted to you, that basically means that she doesn&#039;t care about height at all. if she was, she wouldn&#039;t even be looking at you in the first place. <br>So in a weird way, under 5&#039;4s are almost on a more equal footing with tall men the mid-manlets. since the women they are attracted to them (which are the only women they have access to) have already wordlessly stated that height is not a factor to them. this also means that as an under 5&#039;4, you&#039;re actually more likely to find &#039;tall&#039; women to date. <br><br>case in point there are several women i&#039;ve been with who dated hyper-tall guys before me. when you&#039;re already this short, girls who like you don&#039;t care.<br>point is love yourself i guess? don&#039;t be self hating, people can always sense that, and don&#039;t put down others, no negativity friends.",Alex_Colville_Pacific,.jpg,1996.0,2000.0,124.0,125.0,1612994212829.0,1612994212,+bLqdzkT4750/lsfbrq6zg==,1331664.0,146388944,,,,,,,,146388944,,,,,,,tv

It is made clear that he is a short bastard who despite enormous power and wealth has no hope with a girl even if they are a fucking ogre. Shrek by contrast is shown to revel in his ogreness from the start and use his stature and fearful nature to his advantage, so maybe the message is more one of external discrimination despite internal self confidence? Still seems kind of off because Farquaad is shown to be at least trying to be confident and this is played for laughs. <br><br>Honestly the most coherent idea that can be gleaned from Shrek is that big, strong people get what they want and short people are fucked no matter what they do",,,,,,,,1612997781,,,146388944,,,,,,,,146388944,,,,,,,tv

Shrek and Fiona cope in their own way by moving out of the society that despises them. Farquaad dominates the society that would otherwise mock him. My point is that both strategies work for the most part. <br><br>In terms of how it relates to theme and viewer, we are not shown that Farquaad has any other path to redemption and his height is treated as a joke for the viewer constantly, never is his condition treated in a sincere way as it is with Shrek and Fiona. This is why the message of the film does not work. Shrek and Fiona are not on the same low playing field (literally) as Farquaad.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;They also didn&#039;t live under Farquaad&#039;s rule, where it was readily apparent anyone who mentioned his height and didn&#039;t pander to his delusions were in big fucking trouble?</span><br>EXACTLY.

The movie is basically saying &quot;it&#039;s ok for Farquaad to be the joke because he&#039;s not a good guy&quot; but the joke naturally extends to all short people and not only that, Farquaad is never offered a chance to be anything else. He is never treated as an actual romantic rival to Shrek, which would have been more equal. No, it was always &quot;he is completely updatable and repulsive because of his height&quot;. In this way, Farquaad is not given a reason to be nice, or not to overcompensate, and thus the themes this movie is trying to portray just doesnt work because the standards are different for the protagonists than they are for the antagonist.<br><br>You cant have a cartoony evil villain and then still try and glean some kind of message from their character. Either do a cartoony villain or do a relatable character with an understandable backstory and get the message from that. There is nothing to take away from the portrayal of Farquaad other than &quot;lmao he&#039;s short and has no chance so he&#039;s a bad person to even try&quot;",,,,,,,,1613013500,,,146388944,,,,,,,,146388944,,,,,,,tv

People in the past had their political opinions and could be particularly loud about them. A few years ago I read an entertaining book, and the writer was an overt communist and member of a group of overt communists in science fiction who were quite influential. So I think it really is social media and the shortened time between thinking of your opinion and sharing it with the world, combined with an increased emphasis on emotion over rationality. Even an opinion you don&#039;t agree with, or even think is dangerous, is easier to respect when the person holding it respects your intelligence enough to at least make an attempt at a convincing argument.<br><br>Simply put, if Brandon Sanderson wrote an essay about how we all need communism, that would have far less impact on my respect for him than if he decided to smear it out over 3000 individual tweets, as everyone else seems to be doing.",,,,,,,,1613008381,,,146397538,,,,,,,,146397538,,,,,,,tv

CIA, the blatant analog for corrupt bureaucratic institutional power, has determined, neigh decreed, that Bane is comparatively a &quot;big guy,&quot; and then mocks his nemesis as such. Certainly, Bane&#039;s large physique here, is being contrasted with the relative small to moderate sizes of the other plane occupants. And manifestly, this series of mental juxtapositions, conducted the very moment CIA first truly glimpses Bane, forms a coherent narrative, or structure, allowing CIA to conclude, then ordain that Bane is indeed a &quot;big guy.&quot; Symbolically, here, the institutional metanarrative is formed, constricting the personal sovereignty of every thinking agent aboard CIA&#039;s plane to interpret Bane&#039;s size for themselves.<br><br>Bane liberates them all, first verbally by quickly countering that he is only relatively large, &quot;big&quot; only when evaluated using CIA&#039;s localized narrative, all of this succinctly translated in the iconic phrase, &quot;For you.&quot; And swiftly, Bane proceeds to break down the bonds of societal control, starting first with his own, quite literally. And thusly the first death blow is dealt to CIA&#039;s once monolithic framework of &quot;bigness,&quot; the motif of relative scale beautifully cemented even further as CIA&#039;s aircraft is then ambushed and overtaken by a much larger and bulkier aircraft, unambiguously establishing that CIA&#039;s own dominant orthodox framework of &quot;guy&quot; measurement could itself be nested within or subjected to another, and perhaps even another, even an endless chain of measurement systems, systems where Bane is not only NOT a &quot;big guy,&quot; but actually a pretty small 5&#039; 9&quot; manlet.<br><br>It&#039;s a piercing and stunningly rendered challenge to the current fraudulent organizational power that wields undue control of societal phenomena.

To them the media reality is the only reality and every single thing.<br>There is no such thing as objective news. There can be objective reporting of the news, but there is no objective metric of deciding what is newsworthy. And seeing as people that don&#039;t specifically look for things but only have them served to them will only see anything outside the miniscule scope of their personal experience on golem media, the media dictates golem reality. And seeing as most viewed media is conglomerated under a select few people, this means those people effectively dictate &quot;objective&quot; reality to golems. People don&#039;t know what they don&#039;t know and they don&#039;t know what they haven&#039;t seen anything about, so if you fill the news with man bites dog golem will think this is what happens everywhere.<br>This is why FBI crime statistics are the first resort of the right at the moment. They conflict heavily with golem reality because if you were to log media coverage of crimes against actual real crimes, you would get, I would wager, almost a complete reversal. The picture the media paints, the picture of golem reality, is nothing like true reality. FBI statistics are more representative of reality, but golem reality is dictated only be media coverage. So despite FBI statstics being more accurate to objective reality, the golem cannot process them. He lashes out angrily and tries to make them go away. Because golem reality is their &quot;reality&quot;, it&#039;s their god, and supplanting it with a different reality, however more reasonable, is sacrilegious.",,,,,,,,1613013582,,,146401425,,,,,,,,146401425,,,,,,,tv
