I just don&#039;t understand, Shark Tale isn&#039;t even Dreamwork&#039;s best underrated movie since that award goes to Megamind. Why obsess over mediocre movies?

The problem is when they say them out loud. Especially with you, you can&#039;t bear to keep these opinions to yourself and feel a compulsion to announce them to the world.

Why do you feel the need to keep saying you don&#039;t like HTTYD? We know you don&#039;t. You just never expand upon the why beyond your bullshit subjective reasoning. How many times do you have to say &quot;I don&#039;t like it because it&#039;s not good&quot;? Who do you think cares at this point?

It&#039;s a parody of a meme in Korea. When Heroes of the Storm failed miserably in Korea, It became a laughing stock among online games. And when they started to release Overwatch characters on Hots(OW sucks now but it was big back then), people started a meme about old Blizz characters abducting OW characters. This meme developed into various comics/videos that seemed to be high-quality OW fanfiction with good art style and plot. But then at the climax, when readers were getting invested and off-guard, fucking portal to Hots nexus opens and kidnaps OW characters, and then it ends with low-res Hots commercial. When people began to expect such endings, memers moved onto characters and ips completely unrelated to Blizzard. And it wasn&#039;t always Hots anymore.

So you get these dude bros who like Batman and complain about how the rest of the universe is confusing/not edgy enough/too unrealistic.

One of the most notable of these is derived supposedly from the teachings of the Sword-Saint, a practitioner in his day. While the mention of swords might make one initially question an entry in this account, it deserves at least a passing mention due to its mostly unarmed nature.&quot;<br><br>The style is defensive first and foremost, and it focuses on gradually building up internal forces necessary to retaliate to an attacker with a single, channeled blow directed towards a point of weakness. This is done through continuous motion in combat with an emphasis on deflection and absorbing blows. While this seems simple to accomplish to an observer, it is much more difficult in practice.<br><br>The most unusual facet of the style is most apparent in its rarest technique. A skilled fighter can, reputedly, build up so much internal energy over the course of a battle that when he looses it, it creates a result not dissimilar to what is colloquially called &quot;Cutting&quot;. (This is a topic expounded upon at length in an infamous sword manual written by a madwoman, so does not need further mention here.) <br><br>While this effect is typically seen only when a Pankrash Circle Fighter wields a weapon, the greatest masters are reputed to do this with their bare hands. Unfortunately, though, I have not in my travels been able to witness such an occurrence, as the style is regarded as something of an archaic oddity in this day and age.&quot;<br><br>- Manual of Hands and Feet",the practice,.png,1050.0,3347.0,39.0,125.0,1612993501717.0,1612993501,EwYaLhRd2zKUMIuTRuBF5w==,860475.0,120814367,,,,,,,,120814367,,,,,,co

Dominating you isn&#039;t a requirement at all actually. She just needs to dominate a certain social environment. Typically in cartoons that will be a school, but could be anyplace with a variety of cliques forced to occupy the same space. The alpha bitch is the queen of the highest status clique. Her status will usually be backed up by something like money, or a highly-regarded title like cheerleading captain. That&#039;s why those show up so often.<br><br>The alpha bitch needs to have significant social influence. A hacker girl is unlikely to have this, and if she does, the hacking thing would take a back seat to playing the archetype, which is purely social in nature. The veteran girl has no social context in that scenario. Maybe if she was also the leader of the neighborhood housewives or a director at a company or something. The important components are status, influence, and being bitchy. She can be a gamer girl or whatever backstory you want, but without those components she&#039;s not an alpha bitch.",,,,,,,,1613008908,,,120829012,,,,,,,,120829012,,,,,,co

Everyone paid their dues to the king in Ba Sing Se, but otherwise ran their own affairs and were largely culturally independent. That&#039;s why Bumi could be named &quot;king&quot; of his city state, yet still answer to the actual Earth King. And this only gets magnified by a hundred years of warfare keeping the Earth King&#039;s forces distracted while the Dai Lee are deliberately keeping the king, and Ba Sing Se as a whole for that matter, disconnected from the rest of the kingdom.<br>Also keep in mind that the Earth Kingdom has had a long history of warlords and civil wars. Chin the Conquerer had taken over pretty much the whole kingdom a couple hundred years prior to Kuvira. To all the petty little feudal governors who probably never got much attention from Ba Sing Se besides taxes and who don&#039;t fully understand the ramifications of being incorporated into a network of high speed rail and telecommunications, Kuvira would just seem like another Chin.",,,,,,,,1612988763,,,120825928,,,,,,,,120825928,,,,,,co

They quoted ASDFilm and the pony.mov series endlessly, laughing loudly at each other and their phones. They tended to wear sweatshirts and worn out shirts. Lot of acne. One of them had probably two dozen zits across his face and neck and it looked painful. Another had clearer skin (generally just one huge crusted zit), but he had these huge, unkempt fingernails that almost looked like claws. That sounds like retarded creepypasta shit, but I swear on my life that it&#039;s true. I heard that some autists do not ever trim their nails, so I&#039;m sure it was that combined with a deformity. Saying &quot;swag&quot; would make at least two of them burst into laughter.

This isn&#039;t helped by him speaking very little and not having any meaningful interaction with the other characters.

MCU Fury doesn&#039;t even have the Infinity Formula like the character does in the comics, AND they were forced to give the role to him due to the deal they made when using his likeness in the comics. Add to that the fact that the TVTropes age demographic all care a whole fuckload more about Avatar than they do about old Nick Fury comics, so half of them probably don&#039;t even know that the character is white in 616. Meanwhile the Avatar example has one character made white and another made black, containing both ways of changing race in one movie and thus being a much more efficient example without anyone being able to fight it. <br><br> Stop being so autistically salty, calling Ultimate Nick Fury &quot;non-canon&quot; just makes you sound retarded.",,,,,,,,1612976312,,,120813351,,,,,,,,120813351,,,,,,co

Because, as far as I understand, this is what these type of women want: they have daddy issues and thus need a dominant figure to literally cling onto, which will free them of any responsibility and just let them be mindless pets/children. <br><br>But these women will never admit to that, of course, because they have so much pride. I like feminism but this is one of the down-sides of that, the dumb slutty women use it as a crutch to pretend like they&#039;re something more. The Harley Quinn cartoon is obsessed with that, constantly owning da malez and showing gurl power. Even though all anyone really wants from these types of women (including themselves) is for them to be someone&#039;s obedient cocksleeve. So that&#039;s another angle to this fantasy: if they submit to me, they would also be admitting that, showcasing themselves as pathetic and infantile and all of their pretense superficial. I would not only prove my worth as a male, but also prove morally superior to those who made me question it. But how to achieve that?..",1584576333275,.jpg,900.0,1201.0,93.0,124.0,1613013265093.0,1613013265,Oc74mGCehaF8a+NjScM7sw==,131970.0,120837225,,,,,,,,120837225,,,,,,co

He had only himself to blame. It started simple enough. When Steven was a lad, Greg had a bad habit of taking advantage of him. Spending a little too much time washing Steven’s butt and privates, being naked in front of him, with boner, and even awkward kissing on the lips. Greg knew that it was wrong. But he couldn’t help himself. While Steven slept in the van, Greg would jack off next to him, pulling down his son’s pants if he was in a more crazed state.<br><br>As Steven grew older, it became clear that he inherited Greg and Rose’s sex drive. He would have questions about erections and sex, and Greg gave very hands on answers.<br><br>Laying Steven down on his back, Greg undid his jeans. His little manhood stood at full attention.

She wants to plod on to her &quot;destiny,&quot; no matter what it is. It very much seems like she has a desire not to be cooped up by anything, so she&#039;ll keep pushing forward, even when the likely result is her death. She gets pretty hell-bent. She wants to go forward, even after the terror of the Great Tree. Even after the House Of Yesterday&#039;s Tomorrows. Even after Demanitus warns them all that the road ahead is perilous. Even when they sing that song about how things might come to an end.<br><br>Rapunzel in Season Two comes off as having more than a little bit of a death wish. I think she wants to live until she dies, in Season Two. She wants her destiny and she&#039;ll take it, even if it kills her.<br><br>And in that regard, Cass betraying her kind of does her a favor. This is what shocks her out of her death spiral. Cassandra&#039;s betrayal makes her realize, &quot;No, there are things I love, I love my home, I love Eugene my one true love, I don&#039;t want to leave, there are things I value.&quot; I think Cass&#039; betrayal and taking of the Moonstone leads directly into the very gung-ho active queen Raps we see in Season 3. Cassandra&#039;s betrayal essentially snaps her out of her desire to destroy everything else in her life. Cass taking the Moonstone makes her realize how much she has in her life that&#039;s precious and valuable, and worth preserving. And as a response to this, Raps goes full mama bear in Season 3 and is determined to protect Corona at all costs, from any enemies, including the enemy of her best friend that she knows is out there.<br><br>Actually this is really interesting. I wonder if Rapunzel would actually have married Eugene, if it weren&#039;t for Cassandra&#039;s betrayal.

In I&#039;d Give Anything after Cassandra in anger stabs her headress, Rapunzel reminisces over their friendship but the images only show Cassandra in her Lady In Waiting costume, as that is what she remembers her by, and despite Cassandra casting off the headdress, Rapunzel catches it, oblivious as to why she is casting it off, thinking instead she must have merely dropped it. She actively enforces Cassandra&#039;s place in society as nothing more than a Lady In Waiting, the fact that she is a badass merely means she sees being a badass as a trait inherent to being a Lady In Waiting.

Rather than being oblivious to Cass&#039; suffering, she has to quietly bear it too, an unspoken rift between them, a lie beneath each smile, a sword of Damocles hanging over them that can never be acknowledged or spoken, for fear it would destroy everything they love. <br><br><a href=""#p120818456"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;120818456</a><br><a href=""#p120818630"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;120818630</a><br><a href=""#p120818708"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;120818708</a><br><a href=""#p120818951"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;120818951</a><br><a href=""#p120818998"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;120818998</a><br><a href=""#p120819195"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;120819195</a><br><br>This is one of the most fascinating debates we&#039;ve had on these threads for some time. I&#039;m not sure I agree with everything but it&#039;s certainly given me a lot to think about that I&#039;d never considered before. Personally I always thought Raps was too good-natured to really see Cassandra&#039;s suffering - she may not be naive anymore, as you point out anon, but at least by S2 I&#039;d say at heart she&#039;s still much the same. She&#039;s too good for this world, to such an extreme it manifests as an almost narcissistic obliviousness. She treats everyone with the same williams-syndrome hyper friendliness, and expects the same behaviour back. I don&#039;t think she&#039;d see anything deeper in Cass&#039; attachment than a reflection of what she feels towards her. <br><br>I mean despite what some anons have said about Raps having high emotional intelligence, arguably Cassandra&#039;s betrayal is to some extent her fault. She sidelines Cassandra for Adira, simply because its in her nature to be totally accepting of everyone, even a total stranger, who Cassandra rightly points out can&#039;t be trusted. Rapunzel&#039;s omnibenevolence compromises the exclusivity of her close relationships, something others expect but she can&#039;t see. <br><br>Like this anon says <a href=""#p120819413"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;120819413</a> Raps essentially comes think of herself as the protagonist of her own story, and treats the world as revolving around her. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s out of arrogance, I think it&#039;s out of ignorance, an inability to understand that others don&#039;t feel the same.",1612821721614,.jpg,1024.0,839.0,125.0,102.0,1612950113007.0,1612950113,kz0s1JxDj51Y8siHtNR9Fg==,184670.0,120810448,,,,,,,,120810448,,,,,,co

Everything in the trailers is from the first episode except Madripoor and the shot of Zemo with his mask in hand from the newest trailer(which is ironically from the last episode) <br><br>Therapy sessions are a bookend for the show, every episode starts/is intercut with them. Ross is watching.<br><br>Flagsmasher is not a major character, just a side character used by Zemo as a distraction. Show in general follows a villain of the week format with the exception of Zemo who is built across the 6 episodes. <br><br>Steve Rogers does not die(at least not in this show). There is a funeral, but it&#039;s for General Ross(he&#039;s not really dead, but going underground)<br><br>John Walker is referred to as Captain America throughout his run with the shield. At one point he is referred to in dialogue as &quot;a US Agent&quot; but that&#039;s it. He&#039;s not a full on villain, he genuinely wants what&#039;s best for the country but he follows orders to a fault and has crippling PTSD. <br><br>Race is a HEAVY theme in the show. Sam isn&#039;t allowed the shield because of the Sokovia Accords, but the real reason is because he is black. When Walker goes off the reservation and beats Eli Bradley in front of cameras, the government tries to give Sam the shield for good PR. This almost leads Sam to forsaking the government entirely but Rhodey brings him back. <br><br>Show doesn&#039;t really set Rhodey up for Armor Wars at all. <br><br>Bucky&#039;s arc is atonement and becoming a human again in the small ways he can. Sharon helps him with this immensely. <br><br>The 5 years after the snap are explored heavily, as is the impact of coming back to a changed world. <br><br>Omega Red and Batroc the Leaper are indeed in the show. They are the villains of episode 3, which is the Madripoor episode. Omega Red is pretty nerfed for the MCU but there&#039;s a canon reason. The word &quot;mutant&quot; is never said. <br><br>Songbird does NOT appear. Neither do the Inhumans in any capacity.

It works better than you think I promise. Sharon is a highlight of the show and one of the most capable characters. <br><br>Ross is trying to recreate the super solider serum again, which leads to Red Hulk.

This is hardly surprising given that our mothers are literally the matrix, knitting us together into bodily and psychic being. On the bodily level, our mother gestates us from the moment of conception, bathing us in her chemical signals, carrying us as her oxygen and nutrient-rich blood pulsates through us, her hormonal cascades keeping us in sync with the stages of intrauterine development, and finally tuning us exquisitely to the momentous event of our birth. After birth, her oxytocin bonds us to her in a state of blissful union. Slowly she awakens us to the world around us, infusing it with magic and wonder, so that everything around us is lit up by her love and pleasure, the flowers that she points out to us, the moon, all become aspects of her. For the rest of our lives, we will long to recapture that first romance, the lost paradise of her love.<br><br>Just saying, it&#039;s cool to admit you want to fuck your own mother. No other women will ever compare. Even Batman is into it and he&#039;s a genius.

Sure, he was power-hungry and ruthless, but so were the leaders of the very first primal people after they&#039;ve just evolved from apes. He needed those qualities to survive. <br><br>I like to ponder, what would have happened if he succeeded? If he managed to get to the surface and force the professor to make more of that serum, or even grow smart enough to make more himself, and produce an army of super intelligent fish people. That would probably be a mini-alien invasion scenario, only in this case the aliens would come from the Earth itself. The government would try to hide their existence/wipe them out/experiment on them, or all three at once. Depending on how many fish Joe could get to and how intelligent they&#039;d become, they could potentially lead an all-out race war with humanity for the right to be the dominant biological unit on the planet.<br><br>Perhaps humanity would eventually end up victorious and the invasion of the fish people would be a very, very weird and controversial page of world history. Perhaps fish people would&#039;ve won and built a society of their own, where centuries later history would remember Joe as a barbarian, but the one whose actions were necessary for the early advancement of fishkind. Or perhaps, after the war has caused heavy casualties on both sides, humans and fish people could somehow come to a compromise and agree to live in peace. And we all would have fish waifus.<br><br>This was a fun little movie when I saw it as a kid but nowadays I can&#039;t help but think that this concept of a large animal group suddenly gaining intelligence and posing a threat to humanity is so much bigger than the movie itself.

I&#039;d really like to show her the Brown Bunny and Weezer and she&#039;d be like &quot;hey thanks for introducing me to this stuff&quot; and she&#039;d show me the shit she listens to (probably metal which would be an interesting education as I haven&#039;t listened to much). Sometimes I like to listen to a little Pinkerton and zone out and think of her. Maybe buying ice cream. And seh&#039;d call me retarded and we could hug and shit. Goddamn. I don&#039;t care about sex. I just want to cuddle Loona GODDAMNIT!!! This is pretty much an obsession of mine at the moment. I guess she&#039;s what normies call a comfort character? I just think of her as a waifu, not someone to have sex with. I&#039;d really love to be in a mutually happy relationship with her. I don&#039;t know about children but if she wanted them bad enough, I&#039;d consider. I just don&#039;t think I would really be a competent father.

Megatron would be a smooth talking gangster type rather than a warlord, Soundwave would be a manipulative bastard, a version of Breakdown that mixes music with caprioera esque fighting styles, a Demolisher that&#039;s basically Wesley Snipes in Demolition Man just for starters, oh and a Bumblebee that&#039;s created on earth and evolves into being a full sentient Transformer.",,,,,,,,1612973579,,,120823594,,,,,,,,120823594,,,,,,co

The war ended when Megatron stole Vector Sigma and attempted to use it to rewrite the sparks of all Transformers and convert them to Deceptions. Optimus Prime tried to stop him, but was defeated in their final battle. But while Megatron was distracted, Spike Witwicky took Vector Sigma and, with no other options, forced it to self-destruct, dying alongside Megatron in the ensuing blast.<br><br>Leaderless and shocked by the loss of Vector Sigma, the Deceptions have no choice but to sue for peace. It&#039;s a victory, but one that Optimus cannot accept. The Witwickys blame him for Spike&#039;s death, and he agrees, believing he has failed irreconcilably by his weakness in a crucial moment costing an innocent their life. He abdicates as leader of the Autobots, and gives the matrix to Hot Rod, who is not nearly ready to take over, before exiling himself to seclusion.<br><br>In the present day, the Autobots rule Cybertron. Hot Rod, now Rodimus Prime, has made the best of the role he was thrust into and has become a good leader, but is continually hamstrung by the Autobot Council, publicly elected officials who are beginning to warp the government&#039;s duties to grasp at more power. These young politicians weren&#039;t there for the war, to see how crucial humans were in aiding the Autobot cause. Now, in the modern day, as humanity begins to colonize the stars and is approaching Cybertron in levels of technological advancement, the Council is growing jealous of them and is beginning to ponder ways of curbing humanity, to Rodimus&#039;s dismay.<br><br>All of this is compounded by a resurgence of Cybertronian extremists: Predacons, a new Transformer subspecies that seems to have originated on Earth itself, bio-mechanical beings that can take on &quot;Beast modes&quot;.",,,,,,,,1612978210,,,120823594,,,,,,,,120823594,,,,,,co

They&#039;ve begun violent insurgencies across Earth, and the humans have begun to blame the Autobots, their allies, for letting it happen.

Still in seclusion on a distant world, maintaining an old records facility, Optimus is reluctant to aid his old protégé. He has grown fearful and regretful in his exile, and doubts the bot Rodimus came looking for still exists within him. But Rodimus is convincing, and reminds Optimus that it was not a Prime who stood up to Megatron all those eons ago, but a simple data clerk named Orion.

Mature shows have characters with serious self-reflection, development and characters that are multi-faced and the shows use emotions to make them relatable, the scenario more realstic (because real people have emotions and aren&#039;t the super though hollywood badasses) and to emphasize the effects the setting has on everybody.<br><br>You know what&#039;s mature?

No movie in the franchise even comes close. There aren’t really any TV shows besides “The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show” and “Peanuts (2016)”, both of which consist of animated compilations of already existing comic strips. “The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show” is pretty solid, but the “Peanuts” 2016 series (which is all on YouTube) is a bit obnoxious in its animation, voice acting, sound design, etc. The first three specials, including Christmas, Great Pumpkin, and All Stars are also good rewatches before you start A Boy Named. Also if you really do like Snoopy, I’d give the movie “Snoopy Come Home” a watch.

I got to &quot;Race for Your Life&quot; recently, and that was the first truly bad one. Peppermint Patty is uncharacteristically mean to Charlie Brown, and the girls in general are annoying. It&#039;s one of the very few Peanuts things to feature antagonists, and it just does not work here. They just seem like they&#039;re there to have a reason for everyone to get mad at Charlie Brown, and to get behind him at the very end. The movie could&#039;ve easily been just Charlie Brown&#039;s, Peppermint Patty&#039;s, and Snoopy&#039;s teams racing each other. It&#039;s also very boring for such an epic-sounding story. All of the best bits are in the first 15-20 minutes before the race begins. &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown &quot; worked a lot better with a much simpler story.",,,,,,,,1612772394,,,120764220,,,,,,,,120764220,,,,,,co

Actually I&#039;m confused now as well. I actually sometimes dislike Peppermint Patty focused specials despite how I really like her as a character. In the comic strip she&#039;s always cool, but for specials I think she can be hit or miss. Think it&#039;s a voice acting thing, or there is something off because the writer isn&#039;t Schultz. I actually like that she always has Chuck beat at baseball in all the specials though. They have a pretty interesting dynamic because she is basically what Charlie Brown isn&#039;t, a naturally talented jock that&#039;s tough. And you&#039;re right, antagonists really aren&#039;t necessary and the fact there was more than one cartoony bully really detracted from how realistic Peanuts usually tries to be when it comes to the kids.

They are direct mirrors of himself and his life experiences. Rerun was expanded upon as a character once Schulz had his first grandkid, which marked a significant change in his life despite his age. Lucy’s changes and development are in direct result of this. This is expanded upon in a lot of Schulz history books, where Lucy is said to “take a more motherly role to Rerun” instead of being a big sister like she is to Linus. It’s the readers job to correlate these characters with real world scenarios and situations that can be relatable to anyone, it’s what Schulz’s goal was.

She will mention her father to Charlie constantly, these interactions (often posted here) make an association between the two men in her life blindingly obvious. Just a couple examples of this are the flowers Patty receives from her dad that she presents to Charlie Brown (October 4th 1970) and Patty informing Charlie Brown of her father-given nickname as a &quot;rare-gem.&quot; When Charlie agrees with this moniker she&#039;s very happy about it and falls deeper in love with him (October 4th 1971).<br><br>If you want a direct example of Schulz making this mental connection Peppermint Patty has between her father and Chuck so abundantly clear that a reader could come to no other conclusion, just look at pic related (June 20, 1976).",chuckdad,.jpg,900.0,609.0,125.0,84.0,1612840548321.0,1612840548,n8snYRnhyjZe/fylAGU32g==,240883.0,120764220,,,,,,,,120764220,,,,,,co

The color of Saturn-Chan&#039;s dress needs to be adjusted to a purple not so deep and calm, something more like the Hex code DC00FF. Sol Invictus should be dressed like the rightmost reference image, but the cape colored instead red with green edge. And finally for appearance, Saturn-Chan&#039;s hair should be dirty-blonde, as to reflect the color of the planet Saturn.<br><br>I of course wish to have Saturn-Chan with an embarassed expression and hand placement similar to her reference image. A knock-kneed posture should also accompany this, again just like the reference image. Unlike the reference image though, she should be standing, as I previously stated.<br><br>Finally, I wish that the Roman appearance of Sol Invictus be preserved as in the two vertical references images.

Hydra in the MCU started out as some weird death cult worshipping an alien and then gradually turned into a massive organization bent on tying to take over the world and establishing a totalitarian regime under their rule. Notably while they did initially join up with the nazis they then also planned to subjugate the nazis alongside the rest of the world. Also post world war II they seem to be employing the trope equal opportunity evil, since known members include women and people of various skin color and nationality. However they still are perfectly willing to use anti-alien sentiments amongst the populace as a tool to seize control over the world (hypocritically because they were founded to worship some alien to begin with).",,,,,,,,1612976119,,,120817865,,,,,,,,120817865,,,,,,co

Oh, is it going to be like a foreigner married into the royal family? Huh, doesn&#039;t seem to be. Yeah, they just took stock fantasy kingdom and stuck a black king at the head and didnt&#039; explain that. Kind of weird since it gives the impression that a foreigner is in control of this other nation and no one cares. Actually why are there separate races in this fantasy world in the first place?</span><br>Nationalism is a recent idea. For most of human history, monarchy houses have been foreign. Just see England. For centuries, their royals spoke French because they came from Normandy. Queen Victoria was German and her royal house was oficially called House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha until WW1, when anti-German sentiments were exploited by the press but they realized the royal family were Germans so they changed their family name to Windsor<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;It&#039;s all one continent and always has been, shouldn&#039;t they all be one race? Yes - they absolutely fucking should.</span><br>That&#039;s not how phenotypes work. They can jump over generations, especially if the parents share the same gene. For example, see the CW Superman. He&#039;s ethnically German but moors did many kinky things during the old days. It&#039;s very obvious a moor gene jumped toward him, probably because both his father and mother had a moor ancestor somewhere.

When I was first told about the show I imagined that dark magic would revolve around killing sentient magic things and grinding them into spell juice. But that&#039;s not universally the case at all since regular dumb animals or even bugs can be the catalysts for spells. <br>Who of you wouldn&#039;t slit a deer&#039;s throat if it meant healing your quadriplegic brother? How is that evil? The only thing the show seems to say is that it&#039;s bad because the spells have serious recoil on the user. Again how is that bad? <br>If you could could burn down a tree and bring back your father from the dead, but you would cripple yourself in the process, is that evil? The vast majority of cultures&#039; archetypal heroes celebrate self sacrifice. This show would tell me that&#039;s bad. Good luck flying in the face of thousands of years worth of culture on that count. <br><br>I really, really think the show has to unfuck its moralizing around dark magic. Yes it had aborting a dragon egg portrayed as a bad thing. Yes it had turning your army into half zombie fire Wights being a bad thing. Those things aren&#039;t self sacrifice though and they&#039;re actually touching sentients.

Even with all the honors and respect the Supreme Intelligence gave him once Mar-Vell decided to align himself with Earth, the Intelligence still changed his outfit to strip him of his ties with the Empire and essentially told him he was a pariah to the Kree and kicked him out. There&#039;s also the fact that he was a Pink Kree and that also got him a lot of hate.<br><br>Not even going to touch on the fact that it was established before Young Avengers started that Mar-Vell never got over Una&#039;s death until he met Genis and Phyla&#039;s mother Elysius and even then it took him awhile to finally enter a relationship with her. Part of the reason he also never got anywhere to serious with Carol was also because of Una. <br><br>I wasn&#039;t really surprised when Gillen put in the idea that Billy created Teddy because a lot of what Heinberg established didn&#039;t add up. But then it turned out that Loki was just fucking with Wiccan.<br><br>That said Ewing does try to make sense of it by saying that Hulkling&#039;s grandma was Tanalth and she was manipulating the Kree and that there was an old prophecy with a Skrull/Kree hybrid. But yeah him being Mar-Vell&#039;s son really doesn&#039;t matter as much as him being Anelle&#039;s and Dorrek&#039;s grandson. Pretty sure in the MCU he&#039;s going to be Annelle&#039;s son with some rando Kree, especially since Mar-Vell died in the 80&#039;s in the MCU and if Hulkling was her kid it would make him pretty old.",,,,,,,,1612936935,,,120809204,,,,,,,,120809204,,,,,,co

There&#039;s so little distinction in color palette between the core cast, and I don&#039;t feel like the fact that it&#039;s in Hell is a good excuse for that. The show itself shows that Hell can be anything you really want it to be, it&#039;s not usually depicted as a city, but here it is. So why do the core demons all have to have a limited spectrum of varying shades of red, white black, and touches of yellow? It&#039;s boring. That&#039;s what really needs an overhaul, employing better use of color to make the core cast more distinct.",,,,,,,,1613000471,,,120827226,,,,,,,,120827226,,,,,,co

It’s also harder to convey age differences with such a simple art style that they need to rely on visual shortcuts.

There is nothing wrong with desiring a more thoughtful approach to cartooning- but beanmouth spam, clear to all, is not a fruitful way to go about it. In reality, &quot;guy&quot; is either one or more people that wish to subvert the narrative of reactionary cartoon rhetoric to the point that the opposite of the standard becomes so reviled that the standard is even more ingratiated than it already is, insofar that at the very least, the predominately &quot;lazy&quot; modern &quot;beanmouth&quot; approach to design is more tolerated, as to defy it in anyway is to be, in some capacity, comparable in spiritual essence to the much maligned &quot;guy&quot; character, and no one wants to be like the &quot;guy&quot; character - he is engineered to be ill-tempered, embarrassing, likes Homestuck - once this threshold is reached, any critique of the modern commonplace approach to cartooning becomes one in the same, and all equally repugnant. At this, theories on who is behind the &quot;guy&quot; character can be extracted - those that play the &quot;guy&quot; character very well may be the &quot;shills&quot; that &quot;guy&quot; posts so often about, potentially even industry professionals that wish to keep the efficient and relatively cheap standards of animation exactly as they are by removing any possibility of opposition at its roots.
