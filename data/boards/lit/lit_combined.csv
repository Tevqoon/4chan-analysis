Remember Jurassic Park? Well that movie made so much money from Korea for the US because every body loves dinosaurs. The Korea government worked out it was more profitable than tech companies while also creating cultural values (like how everyone now knows what raptors are, but only the movie version). They created a scheme to get that same money from every other country in the world, and to imprint the cultural values of Korea on the world. They design k-dramas to best infiltrate regions (they have different ones for, say, France, and the US, with cultural nods to both, but still with Korean mores at their centre). The same thing with K-pop: some groups will target China while others will target the US or Brazil, and mix lyrics in different languages (to encourage further engagement with the Korean lyrics and a sense of familiarity). Part of the culture they are exporting values being a pretty girl as a personality trait: people who make themselves look attractive are seen as having put in effort to not be disgusting to others, while those who have not put in the effort are seen as disrespectful.<br>They&#039;re probably the most evil and insidious form of cuteness since Tribbles.",,17507105,,,,,lit

Desiring-processes are transmutation processes. <br><br>There are Three tiers of Desiring-becoming which are actualization processes.<br><br>First level: Desiring-becoming-Glorious/honored/<wbr>fulfilled-by-other: in this one’s ego-desire is shaped by recognition of the group, this is the common kind of Ego-desire which man experiences, he wishes to become the simulated shifting product which the group wants, he desires to shape himself in order to fill himself with his desire.<br><br>In this is requiring the approval and recognition of the fellow man, in this is the foundational strength of the simulacra, in this is all of man’s current political structures and processes as they rely on recognition of Force, recognition of wealth, of glory, of pseudo-platonic goodness and of being what one ought to do, the Das man-force, the force of “this is what one must do in order to be accepted by the group and not considered foolish” <br><br>This form of bliss and pleasure is the most unstable as the Wheel of time shifts so does the culture and world spirit shift, the recognition of men is constantly twisted and contorted, the dwelling in this pleasure and dwelling in this desire naturally is unstable and imperfect.

For the instrumentality of Will is the key to its power of becoming, and enacting various goals or fitting as a cog allows one to serve as a greater part in a larger whole. This second stage of desiring-becoming is superior to the first because it can be kept up indefinitely as long as the instrumentality remains.

Politically this manifests as all states and political regimes theoretically conceived of which are based in reason or Will, in which man becomes a part of a broader structure of interactions and his meaning is extracted from his place in the structure or even simply instrumentality for its own purpose, His will within the structure is his Own meaning. As the Simulacra forces and nature of techno-capital Matures, organically the first Order is transmuted into the second Order, the Cancerous body-without-organs on a societal level. The strongest and most perfect of these is the Fascist Structure which understands its own nature as a construct and comprehends it is such a structure and is integrating man into nonduality with itself producing and cleaving man to civil virtue and meaning. the True totalitarian state due to its self knowledge gradually over a long period of time also evolves and transmutes itself into the Third Phase.<br><br>Third level: desiring-becoming-acquiescentiant: in the final third form, in this form one gains meaning by conceiving of their entire being as not belonging to a structure but as a machinic assemblage, one is himself a complete structure of god, with no need of fitting into a structure,(one is logos, one is dharma, one is the revelation) one’s desire is to become the resting place of one’s self. In this way one fully in active sense strives to make his own interior-structure, his authentic being his resting place. By actively striving to always rest in his own interior structure (dwelling in the heart, striving in the heart) one constantly enacts desire as true desire-becoming, for he becomes the ouroboros. He is instantly desiring-becoming-himself and he is constantly always having this satisfied for he is always his self most.<br><br>In this desiring-becoming is comprehension fully of one’s innate structure as non-separate to the structuring of all nature and reality, one instantly realizes and fulfills his basic mode qualities. In this is Full actualization of all potential, for ones entire potential and lines of flight for the advancement of one’s desiring processes are perpetually directed into enacting the Reality of his being and the structure and quality of his being. <br><br>In this is absolute actualization of God-in-man, for all desires are instantly satisfied and thus this is the state of supreme desire satisfaction, actively seeking to rest in one’s interior by passively resting in one’s interior.

Absolute actualization occurs since the thing sought is ones own properties and this is the bliss of Kether-Chokmah-Daat. To dwell in the nature of one’s own inherent properties and express them as ones Will with no Will otherwise than to rest in one’s own nature. This is the Supreme Bliss. <br><br>Politically This would manifest as a culture and world in which the Second order has via its structure perfected man to such a point that they no longer require the structure of the outside to determine meaning and cleave them to virtue, but rather by the long term social, cultural, genetic and technological evolution has been encoded at the deepest levels that man ought to abide by his own authentic being, his own structure, Man is a state structure-in-himself. In this is the Fascist state undergoes the alchemical stage of multiplication which is the completion of the philosophers Stone, each man striving to adhere to his own nature, in perfect Wisdom and being naturally accustomed culturally and socially via evolution into his own self-reliant Self-bliss.

It is often translated as &quot;the They&quot; or &quot;People&quot; or &quot;Anyone&quot; but is more accurately translated as &quot;One&quot; (as in &quot;&#039;one&#039; should always arrive on time&quot;). Das Man derives from the impersonal singular pronoun man (&#039;one&#039;, as distinct from &#039;I&#039;, or &#039;you&#039;, or &#039;he&#039;, or &#039;she&#039;, or &#039;they&#039;). Both the German man and the English &#039;one&#039; are neutral or indeterminate in respect of gender and, even, in a sense, of number, though both words suggest an unspecified, unspecifiable, indeterminate plurality. The semantic role of the word man in German is nearly identical to that of the word one in English.<br><br>Heidegger refers to this concept of the One in explaining inauthentic modes of existence, in which Dasein, instead of truly choosing to do something, does it only because &quot;That is what one does&quot; or &quot;That is what people do&quot;. Thus, das Man is not a proper or measurable entity, but rather an amorphous part of social reality that functions effectively in the manner that it does through this intangibility.<br><br>Das Man constitutes a possibility of Dasein&#039;s Being, and so das Man cannot be said to be any particular someone. Rather, the existence of &#039;the They&#039; is known to us through, for example, linguistic conventions and social norms. Heidegger states that, &quot;The &quot;they&quot; prescribes one&#039;s state-of-mind, and determines what and how one &#039;sees&#039;&quot;.<br><br>To give examples: when one makes an appeal to what is commonly known, one says &quot;one does not do such a thing&quot;; When one sits in a car or bus or reads a newspaper, one is participating in the world of &#039;the They&#039;. This is a feature of &#039;the They&#039; as it functions in society, an authority that has no particular source. In a non-moral sense Heidegger contrasts &quot;the authentic self&quot; (&quot;my owned self&quot;) with &quot;the they self&quot; (&quot;my un-owned self&quot;).<br>“",!XS8vrClKs2,17507105,,,,,lit

There was a friendly presence with no body and no gender with me. I walked to the bathroom, its light was on, but stopped when I heard a groan coming from my bedroom, its light was off. The entity asked me if I heard it and I confirmed. Tried to turn a lamp on but it didn&#039;t work. Opened the window for some reason, it was pouring sleet. The entity told me we should check on the neighbor together. An alligator hatchling and a puppy walked in as I opened the door. I knocked on the neighbor&#039;s door. He opened the door, looking very uncanny, as if in a trance. All the lights were on inside, multiple televisions on, many people inside. A young woman sitting on an armchair turned to me and said something I couldn&#039;t understand, similarly uncanny. I realized something very wrong was happening. I hit the neighbor in the head with a broomstick and rushed inside. A tubby man with a rapier with a flat tip, a small disc perpendicular to the blade, chased me into a room where there was something on a bed, tapes or evidence of some kind. The entity that was with me suddenly said that we should grab them and go as I fenced with the man. The tip of his rapier somehow penetrated the similarly flat tip of my broomstick, our weapons locked diagonally. He said he would kill me. I disarmed him and pushed him to the ground. Clobbered him until he stopped moving. His rapier, now badly bent around my broomstick, snagged his bottom lip on the last hit and pushed it into his mouth. <br><br>I did not like it.",,17507105,,,,,lit

If one is faced with two options of life or death, simply settle for death. It is not an especially difficult choice; just go forth and meet it confidently. To declare that dying without aiming for the right purpose is nothing more than a “dog’s death” is the timid and shallow way of Kamigata warriors. Whenever faced with the choice of life and death, there is no need to try and achieve one’s aims. Human beings have a preference for life. As such, it is a natural tendency to apply logic to justify one’s proclivity to stay alive. If you miss the mark and you live to tell the tale, then you are a coward. This is a perilous way of thinking. If you make a mistake and die in the process, you may be thought of as mad (kichigai), but it will not bring shame. This is the mind-set of one who firmly lives by the martial Way. Rehearse your death every morning and night. Only when you constantly live as though already a corpse (jōjū shinimi) will you be able to find freedom in the martial Way, and fulfill your duties without fault throughout your life.</span>",,17511993,,,,,lit

Its especially relevant if you are interested in off-shoots of historical Christianity like Nestorianism and other groups, but also works excellently as a bridge language as many Arab translators utilized Syriac when transcribing Greek text on philosophy, medicine, comedies, many of which are lost and only survive in Syriac formats. It also serves as a great language for poetry as it bases itself on syllable count, not necessarily stress or length, sadly not much has been translated as of yet.

There was no elevator and the stairwell was very old and dusty, and 90 seconds later, Yana was trudging up the stairs in a rather unfashionable black dress with a print of a galaxy on it. She smiled as she came up the final steps, and said hello as she walked in the door. Jake said nothing, only hugged her, his arms wrapped around her thin waist, just above her feminine hips and rear. He felt the soft skin of her thin arms brush against his. Her shampoo (or maybe it was perfume) smelled like heaven. She bent down limberly and slid her foot first out of one show, then the other. She set her purse down on the coat rack. Come into the living room, he asked her. <br><br>She followe, then walked past him into the large living room, as he stopped, turned around, and locked the door behind him. He slid the key into the pocket of his trousers, specially chosen for the occasion, as they fit tightly against his thighs, and it would be almost impossible for anyone to filch the keys from his pocket, even with his consent. Now the three of them would be able to have a conversation and reach a resolution, without anyone stomping out prematurely due to some momentary misfiring of emotion. <br><br>The room was long, two couches sat facing each other. Sveta had been sitting on one of them, reading something on her phone, but hearing voices, she stood, and she now sat on the armrest, facing Jake and Yana. Yana saw Sveta just as she heard the echo of the tall door shutting, and by the time she understood something was not right, the key had already been turned. She stood in the middle of the room, her hand bracing her resting on a table next to her, one arm reaching across her body, crossed tightly against her chest, her hand clasping the upper part of her opposite arm.<br><br>Jake was nervous. They were all nervous. Jake was the only one who understood why there were all here, but even he had no idea what would come next. There was no script for this situation.

The general consciousness seems to be that comma splices are grammatically incorrect, however, I&#039;ve noticed that numerous writers both in fiction and on forums such as reddit, twitter and even here utilize the comma splice in their writings. Even famous author, Cormac Mccarthy utilized the comma splice in the opening paragraph of his book, &quot;BLOOD MERIDIAN: OR THE EVENING REDNESS IN THE WEST&quot;. He said and I quote, &quot; See the child. He is pale and thin, he wears a thin and ragged linen shirt&quot;. Notice, how in this paragraph he utilizes a comma splice to express his ideas. This cannot be a mistake because this is in a published work that is widely studied to this day in academia. So very clearly, the comma splice is acceptable in some cases. The question to be asked then, is WHEN is it acceptable to use a comma splice over a semicolon, a coordinating conjunction, or a period?<br><br><s>Before you ask, yes, I did make a thread about this very topic two days ago.

This literally already exists and is one of the most popular webnovels ever written so I&#039;m not quite sure if stealing it is the way you want to go.<br>2. Think about why your hero is lost in the world. You say family problems, abandonment issues, etc. Look further than that and ask what specific situation could they be in that they think would make them happy. Not just something like &quot;having a loving family,&quot; but a specific moment you can really visualize. Now think, based on what you know about your hero, whether or not that would really satisfy them. What I bet you&#039;ll wind up having to do is give that moment to them and have them come to realize that they themselves are the thing in the scene that doesn&#039;t fit in. Then, they can have an introspective journey from there where they realize or come to accept their place in the world. Mind though that, once again, this is in abstract almost exactly what Worm does.

Germany only exists as a unified entity with Bismarck, and it was a much different shape to current Germany. In Ireland, there are several different &quot;revivals&quot; with nationalism at its core, but with different opinions on how it should be expressed. The most well known of these was Yeats&#039; revival, which is usually called the Celtic revival. There is also the Gaelic revival, which focused on Irish language and not just Irish culture in English, which had some overlap but also some disagreements with his ideas.<br>Many countries on the cusp of feudal systems and nationhood also were entering the modern industrial world, so the emergence of new wealth also led to new sponsorship: libraries start becoming public resources, and Carnegie is their patron; theatres no longer needed royal patronage in many countries, while newspapers were also becoming more &quot;of the people&quot; with inventions like tabloids for use on new forms of transport like buses. Many countries were still in the grasp of imperialist sentiment which had been brewing for hundreds of years, but which was fast running out of unknown lands to conquer and so were having to establish a new holistic view of their dominion: the Boer war is a classic example of this quick turn to nationhood as both identity and right backed by a pseudohistory, as a group of early colonists try to argue their colony as a homeland by right of an imagined nationhood.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;tl;dr- modernity made nations… then you get nationalism as a package deal.</span>",,17511380,,,,,lit

The occult was getting a lot of room at the time as traditional religion was also losing its hold on society- there&#039;s not just a growth of spiritualism and medium/magic shows, along with new religions and occult objects being smuggled in from the new colonies in Asia and Africa and the Americas, but also a massive number of Christian sects which spring up during the era (Jehovah&#039;s witnesses for example start around this time, and only ever establish themselves as a publishing company with full copyright rather than as a traditional religion). Nationalism can become a religion in itself. The Nazis wanted to create a religious feeling for the state, which is why they staged rallies and clubs in a similar fashion to religions. Funnily enough, the Protestant churches, which were linked to and sponsored by historical German states which had only recently unified, really wanted to be the more nationalist of the two. When they tried to become the &quot;nationalist socialist Christian&quot; group as an official title, Hitler, disturbed by the displacement of his new religion of the Nazi state, told them to change the name to &quot;German Christians&quot; so he could put some distance between their nationalism and his. <br>The Boer war usually refers to the Second Boer War, which was a war in Africa near modern South Africa between Boers (think Dutch farmers) and the British Empire. The Boers claimed to be the Orange Free State, a reference to William of Orange, whom the British also claim as one of their state founding heroes.

The Quakers for example would take aim at Presbyterians as pagans, because they didn&#039;t support nudism and total equality of all human beings. Basically any protestants who had to leave for America (the Amish, Puritans, Quakers) were rebelling against Protestants with a more established hierarchy in the same way that Protestants had defamed Catholics a little while before. Denouncing people as pagan without the authority of a state starts around the point the Puritans start leaving Europe: witch trials in Europe for example would need to get the permission of the monarch, and even the Inquisition had to be invited by the head of state. The appeal of America for those new protestants who found any hierarchy as abhorrent as the Catholic hierarchy was that they could denounce both as pagan and have little fear. For an example, Quakers went directly to the Ottoman Sultan and the Pope to explain why the light of God was within all people and therefore none should be exalted above another. Famously, the Pope arrested them, and the Sultan thought they were very nice people for noticing God was inside him. When they went to America to preach to the Puritans there, the puritans examined them for signs of witch marks and then deported them to Barbados. <br>OP might not be good at history, but he&#039;s not as wrong as you make out. Puritans were examining for witch marks without the sanction of a divinely appointed judge. That&#039;s a pretty big move from historical persecutions of paganism, which generally required state sanction.",,17511380,,,,,lit

The year he picked is where it starts to cleave from one to the other but even then it is still vacillating on the concept of nationhood&#039;s inherence. Nations before had held a lineage from God, and absent that, new ways of lineage had to be found. Over the twentieth century you see it completely drop away from the traditional definitions, as rights move to be inherently granted by means previously recognised and come to be more broadly granted. But the Irish revivals at the time often declared their nationhood&#039;s validity to be based upon the system in place before the seventeenth century. Their objection was to the idea of nationhood both of the industrial and post industrial age. Nonparticipation in parliament by Irish MPs starts around this point, as they refuse to recognise nationhood. The British government also ignores a newer definition of nationhood which has just come about as a result of WWI: self determination. Neither opt for the same idea of nationhood or the same definitions of outgroups as the Americans for the course of the century, and only really recently came to an uneasy peace. I don&#039;t think anyone would describe that argument about nationhood as a solely post-industrial secular nationalism. That is hard to do when people still walk around with William of Orange portraits and banners about 1690 AD or make murals about protestant scum.",,17511380,,,,,lit

1103,17508207,02/10/21(Wed)14:08:35,Anonymous,,,,,,,,,1612984115,,,17508066,,,,,,,,"I think it depends where you think the &quot;locus&quot; of personality/character is. If you picture how a person acts as the result of obeying a script or code that precedes the action, you&#039;ve separated cause and effect into two layers, which might not even be true of how the soul/mind works ultimately.<br><br>If you do stick with this two-layer view, you can think of a few basic dynamics. One is that the cause layer (whether it&#039;s genetic coding, &quot;innate character,&quot; the arrangement of humours a person has, or whatever) completely determines and influences the effect layer, and the effect has no influence on the cause layer. On this view, my actions in any given situation are just the application of a pre-set function to the contingent situation.<br><br>Another way to see it is that the function itself changes as a result of its interactions. Maybe the function can &quot;soften&quot; in certain ways, for example if I am innately inclined to be selfish but I receive horrible feedback from my actions, I might eventually conclude that I need to re-write or suppress the &quot;be selfish all the time&quot; sub-routine. You could thus divide the causal layer, the function layer, of character into simple sub-routines (&quot;when x, do y&quot; or simply &quot;always do y when possible&quot;) and self-reflective or recursive subroutines (&quot;when some sub-routine &#039;x&#039; encounters excess of feedback &#039;a&#039;, suppress/modify &#039;x&#039; in proportion to.. [etc.]&quot;). <br><br>This view basically makes the human personality into a completely contingent thing. There is no soul or ultimate point of integrity, the human is a process, and processes can change when they meet circumstances capable of changing them, like a change in brain chemistry from drugs or simpy enough feedback from the environment. Similarly, once the basis of the process (the brain) is destroyed, the process is destroyed.<br><br>This is I think how most scientifically oriented people would view the matter these days. They would say that our genes are functions which determine our brains, and our brains are functions which have algorithmic sub-functions for modifying behaviour &quot;intelligently&quot; in response to stimuli. But you will notice that none of this needs to have conscious deliberation or choice. Everything I am saying could easily be applied to an unconscious computer program. In fact, this is how simple AIs are designed. So on this view, we are just highly complex AIs, with many meta-functions for regulating functions, and meta-meta-functions for regulating meta-functions, etc. But that doesn&#039;t explain where &quot;consciousness&quot; (subjective experience) enters into the picture, what its specific nature or function is. And it doesn&#039;t allow for any free will. We are machines, just very complex ones.<br><br>If you believe in a soul and free will, then character is an interesting mystery. Certainly the soul has &quot;tendencies&quot; (character), but how do these relate to the soul&#039;s freedom? What does it mean for the soul to have &quot;stable&quot; (determinate, unfree) AND free parts? How do they interact?",,17508066,,,,,lit

Now the same situation, but the person conciously recognises and admits to himself that he is jealous instead of pushing the feeling away, now the person can use the anger towards lifting himself up into a superior position instead of trying to get the person he feels inferior (jealous) towards down to his level, so he lifts himself up and the feeling of jealousy goes away.

The Will is somehow &quot;behind&quot; all of its representations.<br><br>He gets this from Kant and Fichte. Kant and Fichte both said that when we normally look at ourselves, as things in the world, we can only &quot;see ourselves&quot; as fixed objects obeying fixed laws, because our normal way of looking at things sees ALL things as fixed objects obeying fixed laws. If we look at a basketball, we see a physical thing that can&#039;t change what it is, just a thing obeying physical causes. If we look at a human, we see a physical thing that can&#039;t change what it is, basically a more complex version of a basketball.<br><br>But Kant, Fichte, and even Schopenhauer all agree that the difference between a basketball and a human being is that if we want to explain ALL of the basketball&#039;s actions, we will always come up with PHYSICAL causes, dead meaningless laws of matter. Why did it fall, or bounce this high, or move? Because something/someone moved it. This isn&#039;t the case with a human being. Sure, you can physically affect a human too. But if you ask questions like: &quot;Why did he choose to do good, even when it would have felt more pleasurable to do evil?,&quot; you have to answer in terms of a soul, or at least another realm that is higher than the material.<br><br>Nobody has an exact answer to what is in this higher realm. Fichte says it&#039;s the &quot;I,&quot; the pure self. Schopenhauer says it&#039;s the pure Will. Kant is implying that it&#039;s your soul. The specific answer doesn&#039;t matter (at least for now, since we can&#039;t know it right now), but the basic idea that you are more than a machine, that something in you &quot;points beyond what you see&quot; to another realm, I think is important. You need to have a little faith in yourself. You have already transcended mere sensuousness, you have transcended being a human basketball. A human basketball would be a pleasure-seeking/pain-avoiding &quot;machine.&quot; Its law of attraction would be pleasure, its law of repulsion would be pain. The very fact that you are not subject to those supposed laws right now, that you are troubled by them, and you are even troubled by the fact that you are troubled, points to your soul having higher possibilities, higher demands, even higher &quot;pleasures,&quot; like moral or intellectual pleasures (the pleasure of knowing the truth, as opposed to just feeling good or bad). Whether you like it or not, you are living evidence that you are not a pleasure/pain machine, not a human basketball.",,17508066,,,,,lit

Plato thinks that ALL good, including low-level sensuous pleasure, exists as an extension of the ultimate Good, which is also the True, and the Beautiful. Truth, Beauty, and Goodness all unite at the highest level and reveal themselves as one. We&#039;re all on the path toward that realisation. The farther we get, the less interesting the basic pleasures seem. You are experiencing the classic platonic &quot;eros,&quot; desire or love, for something &quot;higher,&quot; something that seems like it&#039;s outside you. You are not satisfied with what is inside you, what you have already known and even conquered, i.e. meaningless hedonistic pleasure and mere bodily satisfaction. You have already realised that all such &quot;base&quot; pleasures are somehow lacking, they are only fit for animals and people &quot;sunk&quot; in blind animal behaviours. But you don&#039;t yet have a satisfying replacement. <br><br>That&#039;s what Plato is all about: you are on a path, halfway between being an animal and being a wise man. The halfway point on a path is the loneliest part, and of course you will wonder whether you are even getting to where you&#039;re going. But Plato says, just by knowing instinctively that the path is there, knowing that you have to leave from meaningless animal pleasure and seek something higher, you&#039;ve already proven that something is &quot;in you&quot; that KNOWS, instinctively, where it&#039;s going, knows instinctively (and thus desires: eros) something &quot;out there.&quot; You&#039;re already on the way.

It has a basically platonic structure. You should contemplate beauty and the sublime, and ultimately ascend to the highest nullification of the &quot;this-worldly&quot; and contingent, transcending your own finitude. For Schopenhauer, this would mean cancellation of the phenomenal Representation in favour of the noumenal Will, I think? But for Plato it would mean coming into contact with, ascending to, higher spheres of existence, the natural dwelling of the soul (which is why the soul is so eager to get back there). <br><br>I think all these doctrines have their limitations, imo Plato devalues nature one-sidedly and Schopenhauer ends up with a beautiful but incomplete quasi-Buddhism. Again in my opinion the particular contents of what they said are less important than the basic recognition that we, as human beings, feel naturally tugged &quot;upward,&quot; away from merely sensual living, even away from evil and toward good, we feel ourselves always on that path toward something higher and greater, even though we can only have a general idea of where we&#039;re headed.

Disagreeableness generally means not giving much weight towards how others feel when making decisions, primarily relying on your own logic. It usually also means a tendency to look for trouble. As a teen, David decided that there is no God, there is no value in anything, and that morality is just disguised weakness. He bashed his dad’s face in with a hammer (with the intent to kill, but apparently his dad survived) and was sent to prison for about 8 years (where he was diagnosed with sociopathy). He was cellmates with a devout Christian with whom he constantly debated, and eventually, David actually converted to Christianity. Upon being released from prison, he earned a PhD in philosophy, started a small family, and now runs a very popular Christian YouTube channel. <br>Even though his worldview changed dramatically, he did not lose his personality. To this day he frequently derides and argues with other religious teachers, to the point that some of these men have publicly called for his death. His beliefs changed wildly (murderous materialist sociopath to father/husband who spreads the Christian gospel is quite a transition!), but the personality traits with which he EXPRESSES these beliefs (beliefs CAN be subject to change over time, unlike personality), have not changed. During these two periods of his life, he relied on similar disagreeable behaviors to convey his beliefs, even though his beliefs during these periods were worlds apart. <br>Schopenhauer says that &quot;the means change, but not the ends&quot;. I would argue that it&#039;s almost always the other way around. <br><br> <br>*personality has been found to change from extremely impactful (usually traumatic) events or literal brain trauma, but these are both quite rare.

Most of people who wind up here, wind up here because they lack in the lattet part of my post. I have found the best professions for people like these is something that requires you to work entirely by yourself and gives you results based on entirely objective factors with no human interference (the more subjective the field, the more it will be populated by networking normies and based on nepotism and resemble a high school). One such perfect profession are stocks. I made 40k from 3k in one year and although I feel sad that my more subjective work will never be appreciated, I feel good that the stock market rewards the work that otherwise got ignored by normies in subjective field. Here, I am freed: I use my own money and the market doesnt care whether im sociable or cool or how I present myself, it takes my money and when I hit the sell button if I was right, it will give me more money back. No normie gate-keepers, no dealing with idiots who infest subjective fields and turn it into a social clique. I still feel a bit empty because I think I was intended to use my intelligence in something else, but normies dont want it so..ill be happy with the market. By my calculations I should be able to buy a new apartment by the end of 2022. Fuck normies.",,17503667,,,,,lit

But the margins are small with my list youd make 2.5 players per pick, while the average is 2.00 or so.

Ive worked with some people who scout for NHL now. 5 of them I know of first hand. Three mediocrities, two total idiots (worse than your average forum poster). I realized then that its got nothing to do with competence. I mean i suspected this before but i was initially under the impression that if only you could prove you were literally more correct than 95% of people youd get a gig. But you dont since the whole thing is a buddy-system from the lowest scout up to the GM and that part is hermetically sealed off from the business end and the owner. So yhe business side doesnt know for example that had they used my list (cost one laptop and less than 1k in expenses) theyd get better results than paying an entire staff millions in expenditures. Now ive actually proved this statistically and objectively for a third of the league for a given draft but if you show it to someone in hockey operations they wont care because youre not their buddy and the self preservation instinct kicks in and the people on the business side dont understand the details and wont want to throw their coworkers under the bus. So the owner doesnt know he is spending millions on a staff of idiots outperformed by a man with a laptop and less than one grand in expenditure. And there is nothing you can do about it, you have to descend to a caveman level of idiocy, suck up to the right people and never appear to threatening or too competent against them and ill just never do that i cant pretend so ill rather do my money in stocks and such, the market pays you what you know and thats that no high school social cliques shit.",,17503667,,,,,lit

Mediocrity only happens when you try and apply yourself to something that you aren&#039;t immediately good at. Who are you even measuring yourself against? People who have done the same thing as you, but worked harder, worked longer, and gotten through more failure than you have? Of course the world is not based purely on talent or skill, luck and connections are important too, but you will get a hell of a lot farther if you break through your failure and keep trying to get good. To paint a brighter picture for you, you can either choose to become a pathetic, grotesque, ligotti-esque loser or you can explore the boundaries of your ability by pushing yourself harder in spite of your mediocrity. Going from being mediocre to being just good at something is only a matter of hard work.

From Europe alone I was talking about Rasmus Dahlin before anybody even knew who he was. I considered Elias Pettersson as a better prospect than Timothy Liljegren when no other source did. I valued Pettersson and Hischier as top 15 picks when no other source did (this includes the McKenzie list which is the aggregate of actual NHL scouts). I was raving about Moritz Seider one year before he was even draft eligible and when everbody acted like it was a surprise Detroit took him at #6 I said it was a good pick. I rated Chytil highly before anybody talked about him as a first rounder. I rated Konecny higher than anyone and knew he was going to be a solid NHL player. I ranked Evgeni Svechnikov outside of the first round and he looks like a total bust so far when everybody had him in teens. I knew Simon Johansson was a draft worthy prospect as an overager when nobody had a clue he even existed. I knew Brandon Carlo would be an NHL defenseman that can log 18+ minutes a night and ranked him accordingly when many had him in the 2nd round. I ranked Kotkaniemi ahead of Boqvist when people laughed at me for doing that (only to see Kotkaniemi go ahead of Boqvist in the actual draft months later). I&#039;d rank Jan Jenik highly, watch out for him the kid is going to be a player (he went in the 3rd round and nobody talked about him). I&#039;d compare my list to other sources and came up with names only I rated in the first round (aka they did not appear in the first round on any other list), had 4 such names for a given draft year (when i was doing this publically) and all 4 wound up being full-time NHL players. I ran my draft list through every NHL team to compare the results of what they&#039;d achieve with my list vs what they actually did. Keep in mind I was alone scouting the entire NHL draft (basically impossible to get good viewings of so many players) spent less than $1,000 on streams. Ran the results, it turns out you&#039;d do better than a third of the league with my list. Of course if I could focus on just a region, I&#039;m reasonably sure I&#039;d outperform 90% of acual team scouts. Gave up when I saw who some of the guys who &quot;made it&quot; were (even worked with one of them and if you asked me this guy would ever become an NHL scout I&#039;d laugh at you, nice guy don&#039;t get me wrong but clearly not a guy you want scouting, i&#039;m saying about equal to your average midiwt fan posting on forums, the smarter fans were actually better than that guy). Anyways I knew my entire effort was pointless when i saw some people I knew get into the big leagues who ranged from idiots to average in skill level (the best guy I know in terms of scouting and no it&#039;s not me, the guy is a literal genius, did not even get an interview up to now even though he has been doing it for years and can back it all up with results, but he is a bit odd personality wise so he is never going to get a chance probably).",,17503667,,,,,lit

It usually follows me saying someone is the real deal and being called an idiot only for it turn out that way later on and others hopping on board. Sometimes this persists all the way to the actual draft day (Konecny, Seider, Carlo, Chytil, Jenik etc.) while other times people come around to just holding the same view I held months before them (EP being great, Liljegren being overrated etc.). <br><br>Anyways 1-2 years ago I saw the idiots who were getting hired as actual NHL scouts and switched to stocks. I realized that whatever it is that it takes to convince an NHL team to hire you, I don&#039;t have it (I only have the results but apparently that doesn&#039;t matter as much as I initially thought). So I switched to stocks because it gives me an objective return for being right or wrong without having to get through human gatekeepers and sucking up to them and &quot;fitting in&quot;.

Some of my better picks were Goodfood (tse: food) and Palantir, that was a x4 twice. Made some nice returns on Chainlink as well in crypto. I know things probably won&#039;t go up forever but it&#039;s not like I&#039;m risking a whole lot and I will find a way to make profits even if stocks end up dumping. I&#039;m not totally 100% married to stocks, I feel like I could do a good job buying/selling stuff all kinds of items and making all kinds of bets, so stocks is just something that works for now. My goal is to hit 100k+ (currently at 40k from 3k initial investment) by end of 2022 and then I will re-evaluate. If we crash completely before then, I&#039;m fine too, I only risked 3k and I still have my regular job. Once I have 100k+ and my current savings I will have enough to purchase an apartment of my own which is my current goal. Plus I will leave some capital aside to have to play with moving forward. That said if I see an easy x2+ somewhere I&#039;ll consider dumping even a large amount of my gains into that opportunity before using it on property. We&#039;ll see, I&#039;m not too worried because my worst case scenario is still that I only lose 3k, but I think I&#039;ll be sitting at a reasonably good position by end of 2022 which is when I will re-evaluate what I&#039;m going to do next.",,17503667,,,,,lit

Wondering if you have &#039;registered investment accounts&#039; For general information googling works just fine and the first page is Investopedia which usually very helpful. Also, I&#039;m sure there&#039;s some decent Youtube channels for information on what the terms mean.<br><br>As in the earlier posts suggests you kind have to trawl through /biz/, r/pennystocks (r/Canadianinvestors if your in canada) for stock tickers. You should be thinking both on the micro level: looking at the financials of a company, though in many cases doesn&#039;t matter from 2020 onwards. Then marco level: for example weed stocks crushing it right now due to speculation of legalization in the states - however looking at Canada you can realize that the financials never really panned out even with full legalization. <br><br>And generally try to do Due Diligence on a company which will be on the financial statements on their website i.e. their revenue vs. expenditure, etc. Admittedly, I&#039;m pretty neglectful of this myself sometimes...<br><br>If you do have a registered account look at ETF&#039;s that track certain industries or even general markets. They&#039;re safe and even with Covid they&#039;ll net you money - better than just having it sit in the account. They usually have very little management fees. Mutual Funds are more active trading and are more difficult for in terms of taxation (constant trades) so I&#039;d recommend that if you have an IRA or TFSA (Cad). A Fund under the ticker FID1298 has done well for me, even though their fee&#039;s are quite high (2.5%); it&#039;s gone up ~30% or so this last year.<br><br>I&#039;ll be monitoring the thread if you have questions.

If you don&#039;t have much money then find a broker who will allow you to trade OTC. Those are extremely risky but generally are true penny stocks and even hundred&#039;s/thousands of pennies so you can really maximize an investment. 50,000 shares actually has the potential to do something vs. trying to buy a single Tesla stock. Personally, I lean more to the 0.10 - 1.50 range were they actually have legit business and financials. In Canada those are generally on the TSXV so they have to accord to certain standards for auditing - America doesn&#039;t have anything quite like an intermediate exchange between dumpster tier who knows what and the NASDAQ.<br><br>I think you do need to be a bit risker, but you can mitigate it.

The truth is that every single attempt at metaphysics will always be fundamentally incomplete, because it&#039;s literally the process of trying to make sense of that which is, by nature, almost entirely imperceptible to us on this low plane of existence.

Here’s my notes concerning what little I’ve read of his writings.<br><br>According to Schiller beauty is perception of freedom in the object world <br><br>Seems there is no true spiritual depth within him, as he places a tripartite schema, in which first is the physical, which is transcended by the aesthetic and the aesthetic is transcended into the rational. Meaning the rational which is identifies as the moral is the height of his thought.<br><br>He sees in nature and the physical the purely sensual, phenomena, multiplicity and feeling, within the rational he sees the noumena, unity and the forms. He seems to believe that the aesthetic level is the harmony/midway point between these two.<br><br>Further he holds a tripartite view of history, in which man is harmonized with nature due to his lack of interior and subjectivity, then a kind of tearing collapse occurs when man through culture develops his interior life and this causes a disintegration of his being and reformation, he speaks of it as if now we are balanced in between two evils, the brutal coldness of human bureaucracy and state, and the barbaric and senseless nature of human animalistic urges. This naturally will devour each other resulting in the next step of cultural society in which man is reunited with nature but now with a true interior.<br><br>The physical-material man and level of being is driven by a will and force in man which seeks pure objectivity, in contrast he sees an identification with the absolute with the absolute I(which he calls person) and he cites Fichte. Logically the harmony of objectivity and subjectivity would be the aesthetic level in this model.<br><br>Pervading Schiller is a thought I find somewhat antithetical to his friend Goethe(as explained in his confession of the beautiful soul) Schiller argues that there is a kind of natural rhythm and harmony in nature and that good taste is found by learning this pattern, that the aesthetic leads to/synthesizes with the rational through taste. Man’s primary education being the learning of this pattern which he inherently finds beautiful. This is very much in line with schelling’s conceptions of nature as poetry and the internal rhythm of creation.<br><br>In Goethe’s work he finds that beauty and advancement of the soul is attained through harmonization of the interior virtues and ideals with the identity and daily life, a union of the soul and the daily self. This is what it means to beautify the soul, to live in accordance with its deepest impulses and Its own rhythm. I imagine the conflict arises because to Schiller, the rational perception of certain patterns in",!XS8vrClKs2,17510610,,,,,lit

This fascinates me and I believe it’ll be better demonstrated by his Philosophy writings.

I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m some sort of great writer yet, but if you know, you know. You either have it or you don&#039;t. Many writers have said this. Sure you can learn English, you can learn grammar and prose, poetry, and formulaic writing, but writing is more than that and you either have that passion and skill or you don&#039;t. I know I can write very well and that will only grow in time. I wouldn&#039;t be wasting my time if I couldn&#039;t because a lot of people do and writing a book is some catch-all hobby that everyone wants to do at some point whether they&#039;re actually talented or not. I don&#039;t give a flying fuck what these total faggots crying ITT have to say about it lol because I&#039;m right and it&#039;s not a hard concept to understand.<br><br>The point is that true literature has always been niche and this is only getting worse. Like less than 20% of Americans actually read fucking physical books anymore and far less than that read more than a handful a year. Stupidity is at record-breaking levels (as evidenced by the thread) so if you want to create your breakthrough avant-garde novel, you aren&#039;t going to make shit off of it unless you&#039;re already famous.

Not the old school ones who are all retiring now, the last generation or even two generations of middle manager scum who have squeezed out those old ones, so that only a few 80 year olds still cling on for dear life. I have worked in several libraries. I will tell you who works in libraries. There&#039;s the fat old people who are perpetually a year from retirement but who cling on for dear life because they have nothing else. They sometimes care a little, but more likely it&#039;s just a job to them. There&#039;s the never-ending blob of managers and manager-managers who have six lunches and conferences a week to plan how to boost &quot;public engagement&quot; by giving out AIDS-positive pamphlets in the lobby and further displacing the actual book collection to where it won&#039;t bother the Asians who are only there to do their organic chemistry homework and chew their lunch with their mouth open. There&#039;s the new generation of twenty-to-thirtyish women with &quot;Information and Data Management Services&quot; degrees or something equally empty, who have nowhere else to be and would act and function exactly the same in literally any other office environment they wound up in, that is, like busybody cunts who fill the child-shaped void in their life with office drama, tinder penis, and desperately trying to maintain their social networks from college by being an opinionated bitch on twitter. And then there&#039;s one guy somewhere in the back who actually got into library work in the &#039;70s because he loves books and whose soul has been crushed by 50 years of sociopaths and retards treating him like the office whipping boy. <br><br>The only profession filled with more odious people than library management is nursing. Nurses are all narcissist idiot women whose brain is 2% dedicated to improper and dangerous medical care and 98% dedicated to posting on facebook about how nurses are all superheroes and other emergency services workers should bow down to them and convert all their pensions into one giant superfund for a perpetual nurse worship party that never ends.",,17502529,,,,,lit

Not only is that not actually a Traditional viewpoint but the man himself also maintained that certain valid Traditions were nonetheless totally disagreeable to certain people. It’s not a matter of picking and choosing what fits your fancy and literally never has been. <br><br>René Guenon and Julius Evola are probably the two biggest voices in and around the Traditionalist circles, with much of the credibility we lend to René Guenon actually coming via Julius Evola but if you actually read his letters it becomes plainly obvious that Guenon was rather confused himself and frankly, not at all willing to engage with the most serious of scholarship to benefit his readers. Guenon will lead you in a whole array of directions except for one very obvious one and that in and of itself is telling. The fact that a Westerner, raised in the West, who proclaimed himself to be in search of a valid Tradition belonging to the West, absolutely refused to engage with the Orthodox form of his own Western Tradition is the greatest disservice he could have ever given his readers. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt; The politically motivated destruction or the Templars led to the diminution of esoteric knowledge in the West. Those who maintained such knowledge were forced to do so clandestinely. Thus the alchemists had to disguise their true purpose. The Rosicrucians, who also continued the tradition, had to hide behind the story that they had all scattered to the East. That describes their state of consciousness, not their physical locale. Guenon claimed to trace some evidence of esoteric teaching in Protestantism, although even Jacob Boehme ran afoul of the authorities. From there, the trail went dark, apart from occasional clues. Nevertheless, the Tradition can never disappear; there will always be a remnant. Since Guenon’s death, there have been other developments, of which he was unaware, that alter the picture. First of all, there is the remarkable case of Vladimir Solovyov who had his own realizations of Divine Sophia.</span>",,17505609,,,,,lit

According to the entries in Lampe&#039;s A Patristic Greek Lexicon, the basic terms hesychia and hesychazo appear as early as the 4th century in such fathers as St John Chrysostom and the Cappadocians. The terms also appear in the same period in Evagrius Pontikos (c. 345 – 399), who although he is writing in Egypt is out of the circle of the Cappadocians, and in the Sayings of the Desert Fathers.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The term hesychast is used sparingly in Christian ascetical writings emanating from Egypt from the 4th century on, although the writings of Evagrius and the Sayings of the Desert Fathers do attest to it. In Egypt, the terms more often used are anchoretism (Gr. ἀναχώρησις, &quot;withdrawal, retreat&quot;), and anchorite (Gr. ἀναχωρητής, &quot;one who withdraws or retreats, i.e. a hermit&quot;).</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The term hesychast was used in the 6th century in Palestine in the Lives of Cyril of Scythopolis, many of which lives treat of hesychasts who were contemporaries of Cyril. Several of the saints about whom Cyril was writing, especially Euthymios and Savas, were in fact from Cappadocia. The laws (novellae) of the emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) treat hesychast and anchorite as synonyms, making them interchangeable terms.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The terms hesychia and hesychast are used quite systematically in the Ladder of Divine Ascent of St John of Sinai (523–603) and in Pros Theodoulon by St Hesychios (c. 750?), who is ordinarily also considered to be of the School of Sinai. It is not known where either St John of Sinai or St Hesychios were born, nor where they received their monastic formation.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;It appears that the particularity of the term hesychast has to do with the integration of the continual repetition of the Jesus Prayer into the practices of mental ascesis that were already used by hermits in Egypt. Hesychasm itself is not recorded in Lampe&#039;s Lexicon, which indicates that it is a later usage, and the term Jesus Prayer is not found in any of the fathers of the church.[5] Saint John Cassian (c. 360 – 435) presents as the formula used in Egypt for repetitive prayer, not the Jesus Prayer, but &quot;O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me.</span><br><br>All of this predates Islam itself, let alone sufism.",,17505609,,,,,lit

In Orthodoxy, you can see a synthesis between what Traditionalists might refer to as right and left hand path, one exoteric and one esoteric, into one spirituality in some sense. Now, a Traditionalist might propose that’s not Traditional but who’s to say? The fact is that Guenon and as a result, his entire milieu and subsequent school was tinted by their association with the neospiritalist and occult movements of the early 20th century and while they came to reject many of their ideas, they never really escaped their way of thinking. There’s another element here which I think is the single greatest shortcoming of René Guenon and one in which his failure to overcome did the greatest disservice to his readers that anyone could ever do and that’s to be totally blinded by your own personal affinities. For Julius Evola, that was his politics. For René Guenon, it was his orientalism. Both were too stubborn, too stuck in their own ways, to actually engage with an investigation into their own Tradition in a nuanced way that is deserving of their readers. Now, I’m not actually an Orthodox Christian. I’m just a reader who is interested and I won’t claim to say I know better, or I know the circumstances, or I know that Orthodox Christianity is true Tradition of the West or anything so bold. I just think we have to acknowledge, and I’m rather confident in doing so, that while we can glean insights from this author, there are simply areas where, by ignorance or inability, he totally failed to perform the sort of investigation that was due. It’s not to anyone’s benefit Christian or Muslim, to pretend otherwise.",,17505609,,,,,lit

What I’m saying is that you’re shifting the meaning of truth without realizing it. This all started because you said basically you don’t know why you should accept one particular religion, in this case Christianity, and you implied a degree of relativism when comparing it universally with other religions. I’m simply trying to walk you through the justification why you might accept Christianity as true and only Christianity as true. You already accept the notion of objective truth. So let’s say I’m a Christian apologist and I show that logically Christian belief is fundamentally at logical odds with let’s say Islam, meaning they can’t both be true at the same time and you agree that my arguments are true. Let’s also say that I make a series of arguments supporting the idea that Christianity is the one true religion and you also agree that those arguments are true. Because you accept objective truth, you have no choice but to also accept that my argument that Christianity rather than Islam is true. The only reason you would come to deny this is if you shift the meaning of truth to mean something more subjective or totally different but you already said you accept objective truth. So either I, the Christian, am making claims which are objectively true, or I’m not. You’re confusing here the ability to move beyond linguistic frameworks for relativity of meaning. Truth can be said to be a transcendental and that’s why we rely on God to justify it but it’s meaning can’t be said to be relative. Otherwise, you don’t actually have any objective truth and you can’t make sense of anything.",,17505609,,,,,lit

Radical anti-natalism as a recipe for human extinction will fail because any predisposition to share that bias will be weeded out of the population.

Complications aside, any predisposition not to have children or to adopt is genetically maladaptive.

But voluntary childlessness or adoption is not a global solution to the problem of suffering. </span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Yet how should rational moral agents behave if - hypothetically - some variant of Benatar&#039;s diagnosis as distinct from policy prescription was correct? </span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;In an era of biotechnology and unnatural selection, an alternative to anti-natalism is the world-wide adoption of genetically preprogrammed well-being. For there needn&#039;t be selection pressure against gradients of lifelong adaptive bliss - i.e. a radical recalibration of the hedonic treadmill. The only way to eradicate the biological substrates of unpleasantness - and thereby prevent the harm of Darwinian existence - is not vainly to champion life&#039;s eradication, but instead to ensure that sentient life is inherently blissful. More specifically, the impending reproductive revolution of designer babies is likely to witness intense selection pressure against the harmfulness-promoting adaptations that increased the inclusive fitness of our genes in the ancestral environment of adaptation. If we use biotechnology wisely, then gradients of genetically preprogrammed well-being can make all sentient life subjectively rewarding - indeed wonderful beyond the human imagination. So in common with &quot;positive&quot; utilitarians, the &quot;negative&quot; utilitarian would do better to argue for genetically preprogrammed superhappiness.</span>",,17510956,,,,,lit

A person who is currently alive may be happy with their life and want to continue living. However, it is still unethical to create someone else who might not feel the same way. Since there is no way to know how they will feel and no way to receive consent to take the risk, it is not morally justified to reproduce.Furthermore, people who are born may suffer but still be concerned about how their friends or family will react to a suicide. So even if they are miserable, they will not commit suicide and continue suffering for the sake of others.

The pessimist would be characterized by the following traits: he is deeply unhappy, hates himself and existence (p. 2), seems especially grumpy and incapable of any joy, is a desperate person (6), who adores the negative, death and everything that is connected with non-existence, that “makes nothingness positive” and turns it into a kind of divinity (21), which has his pessimistic attitude by personal problems to insert himself in life, among the happy people; an annoying bastard and killjoy, somewhat crazy (and possibly homosexual, especially if he speaks ill of procreation and fatherhood)...</span><br><br>Still within this first straw man strategy, it is curious that when an optimistic philosopher claims to have discovered something (for example, freedom, dignity of the human person, the eternal in man, etc.), it is considered that he has discovered something for humanity; but when the pessimist discovers something unpleasant (perverse infantile sexuality, mortality, structural pain), what he discovered_is valid only for him_ and not for humanity. Ever since I began to write on these issues, objections have almost always gone in this direction: “Pessimism is a personal, subjective and non-universalizable posture; you are like that, those are your personal characteristics and of many people as sick as you”; but I never hear any criticism of “subjectivity” when the results are beautiful. (Of course, this and other outrageous asymmetries are allowed to the optimist who, as MV says cheerfully, accepts reason only when it is convenient, but reserves the right to reject it when it is not).",,17510956,,,,,lit

Also, the notion of conceptual construction would appear to entail - not only something foundational on the basis of which constructed entities can be constructed, but also - someone or something foundational who or what is doing the constructing. If it is contended that all entities are conceptually constructed, this would seem to necessitate an answer to the question, conceptually constructed by whom? If it is then said, as a consistent Madhyamika presumably must say, that whoever conceptually constructs is himself conceptually constructed, an infinite regress results.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;I don&#039;t think that I can make sense of the idea that even the agent (be it the self, the mind, or the flow of impermanent cittas) which conceptually constructs entities is itself a conceptual construction. The explanation that the agent is itself a conceptual construction begs the question, for such a conceptual construction would itself require an agent to do the constructing. The meaning of &#039;conceptual construction&#039; presupposes an agent which is a perpetrator of, and is logically prior to, the conceptual construction.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;This in no way contradicts the important psychological spiritual point that, in many respects, one&#039;s views about one&#039;s self and the world are conceptual constructs (e.g. as a result of upbringing, habit, education, and, arguably, karma). I am simply making the compatible philosophical point that in order to have conceptually constructed views about who one is and how the world is, there must be someone/something itself unconstructed which has the views, or is doing the viewing. The very idea of conceptual construction seems to imply, then, both some material, itself unconstructed, which is the basis of construction, and also some agent who is the constructor of what is constructed. Yet, according to the interpretation which I have presented, in his assertion that all entities are conventions, i.e. prajnaptisat, Nagarjuna precludes the possibility of either of these necessary requirements for conceptual construction~ If, therefore, as Nagarjuna seems to say, the ultimate truth is that all entities are conventional truths in the Abhidharma sense, then it seems to follow that - unwelcome -as the conclusion might be to Nagarjuna himself - in fact nothing whatsoever exists at all. Nagarjuna is, as his opponents contend, a nihilist.</span>",,17505219,,,,,lit

It seems to me this would not have been seen as sensible at all by the great majority of other Buddhist scholars, not to mention of other traditions, since it is a straight forward contradiction to claim that all things without exception are constructs. There has to be something which is not a construct in order for things to be constructed out of it/them. Otherwise we in fact have no constructs at all, this would have to be an ontological nihilism. This is precisely the accusation widely levelled at Madhyamaka in India. </span><br><br>David Burton makes essentially the same point:<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;One can see here why opponents of Madhyamaka - as represented even in Madhyamaka texts - accused the Madhyamikas of nihilism. They perhaps have a point after all. For an entirely fabricated world - with no basis at all which is real, i.e. anything more than a conceptual construction - would seem to be hardly distinguishable from a non-existent world. Conceptually constructed things, it can be contended, need an unconstructed basis out of which they are constructed. Arguably, also, conceptual construction requires an agent of the construction - someone or something which is doing the constructing - which is not him/itself a conceptual construction. Perhaps, then Madhyamikas have gone too far in asserting the merely fabricated nature of all things. The Madhyamaka philosophy, it can be claimed, is not the Middle Way after all. It has fallen into the extreme of nihilism.”</span><br><br>1/2",,17505219,,,,,lit

If there is no ultimate ground for dependent entities to stand on they will all fall down, and in the end we will be left with nothing at all, and will end up with ontological nihilism—which is exactly the point Asan ̇ga makes in the Bodhisattvabhumi. And since at least the appearance of some things existing exists, this nihilistic conclusion is contradictory. <br><br>Fortunately this worry is easily resolved. If we consider the structure of dependence relations, we can distinguish three possible scenarios. Either the dependence relations are grounded in independent entities, the dependence relations go on forever, or they close back on themselves in a circle. If, as Williams and Burton correctly state, the Madhyamika will want to reject the scenario that conventional things exist, we are still left with scenarios two and three. Both are demonstrably consistent, so we need not worry that there is any contradiction hidden in them on the theoretical level. Contemporary interpreters of Madhyamaka have usually opted for the dependence-circle as the preferred way of spelling out the structure of the theory of emptiness. Joseph Walser remarks that<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Rupa and so forth are designated on the basis of karya/karaṇa. But because these two are designated based on each other, like two sheaves of reeds leaning one against the other (to use a metaphor commonly associated with dependent origination) there is no regress. This is not a temporal relationship of causal dependency but an atemporal relationship of conditional necessity. No further element is necessary. </span><br><br>The important point to take into account is that dependency-structures do not have to be hierarchical, with independent substances at the bottom and various levels of constructed entities at the top. They can form networks where following the chain of dependence relations we may finally end up at the very place we started. We can therefore put the Williams/Burton argument to one side. It does not show that the Madhyamaka rejection of a well-founded dependence relation is contradictory, nor does it demonstrate that the denial of the existence of a foundation entails that nothing exists whatsoever.<br><br>2/2",,17505219,,,,,lit

Westerhoff writing in the Indian journal of philosophy (springer) also writes about how Shankara&#039;s attempt at refuting Madhyamika:<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Sankara’s criticism of Madhyamaka is brief and somewhat cryptic. In his commentary on Brahmasutra 2.2.31 he rejects the śūnyavāda by pointing out that the worldly convention established by all epistemic instruments cannot be denied while another reality has not been obtained. While the precise import of this statement is not clear what is important is that Sankara characterizes the Madhyamikas as denying conventional reality. As it is clear that they would reject the existence of anything at the level of ultimate reality, adding the rejection of conventional reality just amounts to the rejection of everything altogether. If nothing exists at the level of either conventional or ultimate reality, the resulting position must be a form of nihilism.In his commentary on Bṛhadāraṇyaka Unpaniṣad 4.3.7 Sankara gives a slightly more detailed criticism of the notion of emptiness. He notes that Indeed whether the object, the pot etc. was non-existent or existent, in both cases the real existence of the consciousness of the pot etc is certainly admitted by you. That cannot be denied, for there is no argument supporting such a denial. In this way the emptiness of everything is refuted. San ̇kara points out that even if there is no pot, there is still the representation of the pot in consciousness. Yet if this appearance of a pot in consciousness is taken to be sufficient to refute the “emptiness of everything” this must be understood as a theory that not only says that there are no pots, but also that there are no appearances or representations of pots. Keeping in mind the characterization of Yogacara and Madhyamika by Kumarila we have just seen (Yogacarins deny external objects, Madhyamikas deny both external and internal objects) we can understand Sankara denying the consistency of the latter position. Even though we may reject the existence of external, material objects, the existence of their representation in consciousness is supported by all epistemic instruments and cannot be refuted by any argument.</span><br>So yes he clearly has read Shankara<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;An Indra’s net of not really existing things with no real existence anywhere still leads to ultimately nothing existing</span><br>a conventional Indra&#039;s net is valid, again you keep making the mistake that ultimate existence of emptiness = nothing exists at all.

On his way into the depths of ignorance--the storefront, recently overthrown by a pleasure- and gain-seeking oligarch by the name of Sneed--Homer is harassed by two citizens for appearing &quot;out of style&quot;, so to speak, a clear reference to the daze, confusion, and mockery that Plato says the philosopher is subjected to when he first re-enters the darkness of the cave. Homer struggles to respond to their jibes, but is only able to leave them in a huff as he resolves to further explore the depths of this depravity and reach the heart of the matter--Sneed himself. The brilliance of this scene cannot be understated. By having Homer himself be &quot;of the city&quot;--a &quot;cityslicker&quot;, if you&#039;ll forgive me the vulgarity used by one of his interlocutors--the Simpsons writing team flips the paradigm on its head, implying that Homer himself dwells not in just any old corrupt city, but the very City in Speech itself, made manifest. Whether he succeeds in his encounter with Sneed will be explored in my next video.

Both are long format and handle the topics they choose with depth and broad casts of characters, most of which have some adequate depth. LoGH was even based off a move series. The Wire was written by journalists. Both of them take their respective medium and inject them with literary prowess that elevated them to the peaks of their medium. I’m not sure many other TV programs have done as good a job at maintaining quality all the way through. I can think of a few shows that almost hit that greatness but fumbled it by the end. Though, I know there will be plenty of anons who disagree with be because it’s anime and black people.",,17504458,,,,,lit

For Thérèse, her struggles in faith led to a deepening trust and surrender to God in the face of apparent nothingness. The philosopher Nietzsche&#039;s antipathy to Christianity and religious faith in general made him a key architect of the Culture of Death and a precursor of the Death of God movement. This book, crafted as a dramatic dialogue between the young Carmelite and the philosopher, reflects the church&#039;s efforts to understand, listen to, and dialogue with those usually considered afar.</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Nietzsche Is My Brother is the result of the author s own personal religious quest, which led her to the Catholic Church and eventually to enter Carmel in South Africa as a cloistered nun. The book won first prize in the International Competition for Religious Drama.</span><br>https://www.amazon.com/St-Therese-L<wbr>isieux-Nietzsche-C-D/dp/0935216790<br><br>See also:<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;How would the conversation go if Frederich Nietzsche met St. Thérèse of Lisieux?</span><br>https://www.catholiceducation.org/e<wbr>n/religion-and-philosophy/philosoph<wbr>y/how-would-the-conversation-go-if-<wbr>frederich-nietzsche-met-st-therese-<wbr>of-lisieux.html<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;A Dialogue Between Therese and Nietzsche</span><br>https://thetablet.org/a-dialogue-be<wbr>tween-therese-and-nietzsche/",,17500837,,,,,lit

I miss you, baby.” <br><br>These were the final words of the famed actress’ press conference. Her tear-filled eyes had sought out one of the many cameras lined up in front of her and she had looked straight into its lens while uttering her emotional plea. The dramatic images headlined news broadcasts across the globe and made an impression on anyone who had tuned in to watch. <br><br>A week later, her husband was still missing. The star of last year’s highest grossing blockbuster seemed to have vanished into thin air. The disappearance caused Hollywood’s rumour mill to go into overdrive, churning out wild theories ranging from a hostage situation to an alleged drug overdose at a controversial spiritual retreat in the Himalayas. Others hypothesised that the actor had run off with one of his many flings. <br><br>Another week passed with no sign of the actor. Meanwhile, a frenzy had erupted on twitter after a man posted a picture of himself standing next to the actor’s statue at Madame Tussauds London, capturing the post with the hashtag #FoundHim!. An offended fan of the missing celebrity saw the post and responded to it with a scathing reply and a hashtag of their own, #BurnTussaudsToTheGround. Both hashtags went viral and, as a result, spawned a flood of photographs of tourists mimicking the picture which had caused the fuss.<br><br>At the same time, Madame Tussaud’s social media accounts were bombarded by irate admirers of the actor who accused the museum of placing profits over feelings. The actor’s statue was, indeed, one of their most popular attractions. Notable for being the museum’s most kissed statue, hundreds of visitors posed for pictures with it every day. Even after his disappearance, droves of women still queued up to wrap their arms around the actors chiselled physique and plant a kiss on his waxy cheeks.",,17502349,,,,,lit

However, following the social media storm, they had decided on temporarily removing the statue and placing it in their storage facilities. A sizeable donation by the museum to a charity championed by the missing actor was also made. <br><br>Not long after this statement was released, the outrage subsided. The chairman of the museum congratulated his staff on their handling of the situation, adding, in a subdued, yet satisfactory tone that the museum’s ticket sales had gone through the roof. Little did he know that his decision to place the statue in storage would, ultimately, prove to be the first step in uncovering what is now regarded as the single most sensational story to have ever come out of Hollywood.<br><br>It was a female member of the storage facility’s maintenance crew who, inadvertently, set the ball rolling. The lawyer of the woman, who would like to remain anonymous, claims her client spotted a bug crawling up the statue’s pant leg and that this was her motive behind pulling down the statue’s trousers and underwear. Security camera footage of the incident, which had leaked from the museum’s security team, cast serious doubts over her statement.<br><br>The rather grainy footage shows the cleaning lady taking her time to unbutton the statue’s jeans. Then, again in unhurried fashion, she is seen pulling down the silk boxer shorts. Up until that point in the video, her assertion could, in theory, be considered truthful. However, the last minute of the clip that has now gone viral, which show the cleaning lady taking out her phone and snapping several pictures of the statue’s genitals, shatter her credibility entirely.<br><br>Astonished by the statue’s detailed work, the cleaning lady sent the pictures to a handful of friends. Equally perplexed, they replied that they had no idea the museum went to such lengths when creating statues. The photographs then, somehow, ended up on an obscure forum dedicated to male celebrity nudity. The thread containing the images initially gained little attention, with forum members casting doubts over the authenticity of the pictures. The creator of the thread posted a final message admitting they weren’t genuine, adding that “still.. M.T. really care about the detail lolllll.”",,17502349,,,,,lit

He also has yet to divulge how he could tell that the genitalia in the pictures did indeed belong to missing actor and not his wax statue. A day after the story broke, a Major Investigation Team belonging to London’s Metropolitan Police raided Madam Tussauds and made the grim discovery. In a joint statement the following week, both the MET and the FBI admitted they were stunned by the complexity of the murder.<br><br>From the evidence and information they had managed to gather, they suspected the famous actress had paid for her husband to be killed. They presumed the body was then embalmed and mounted, likely by a mortician or a highly skilled taxidermist, and transported to London where it was swapped for the wax statue on display at Madam Tussauds. Exactly how and when they had managed to succeed in carrying out their elaborate ruse remained a mystery. <br><br>In the months following the investigation, several of the museum’s staff were arrested. All but one, an acclaimed marketing strategist, were eventually released. Also apprehended were a taxidermist renowned for his extensive work with celebrity pets and the pilot of a private cargo plane specialised in refrigerated transport. No less than 37 warrants were issued for individuals suspected to have been involved in the crime, ranging from truck drivers to alleged hitmen with links to Russian crime syndicates in the L.A. area.<br><br>As for a motive, the FBI has yet to make an official statement. However, speculation that a romantic motive was behind the murder appeared to be confirmed during the apprehension of the deceased actor’s wife. A veritable swarm of journalists, camera crews and photographers had congregated outside her Hollywood mansion on the day of her arrest. As she was huddled into the unmarked police SUV, the dozens of microphones aimed at her recorded the handcuffed actress’ chilling words that would go down in Hollywood infamy.<br><br>“Well, he liked being touched and kissed by other women. So, I gave him what he wanted.”",,17502349,,,,,lit

Should They be thanked for a good harvest, or cursed when little Ivyn fell ill? Ullr wishes to return to that age of innocence. No sane man could ask such questions now. The Gods exist. It is fact. And They are terrible to behold.<br><br>The eternal battle between The Grey (God of Decay) and The Green (Goddess of New Beginnings) has always been an even match, so regular it gave the world its seasons. Then, in what Ullr now only calls ‘the long year’, winter did not yield to spring. The cold clung like a conqueror, deepening into a bone-chilling frost. The earth belched rock and ash, and death claimed the land. The sky turned black with the smoke of forests burned for warmth, herds of animals perished as shepherds butchered their own flocks before thieves could, milkless mothers driven mad by their wailing babes would run into cast themselves into fires to escape the sound. The world was dying.<br><br>Ullr’s wife, Sigyn, had just delivered a son that summer. It was not yet time for naming, but he was already showing the man he would be. Square and serious like Ullr, but his eyes shown with his mother’s cleverness. He cried the way Ullr spoke: rarely, and always to a purpose. They had prepared for a comfortable winter, putting in long days through the autumn to have provisions for all that may come. Still, they were not prepared for this.<br><br>Cold and hunger they could hold at bay, but not the desperate men that came to beg for food or wood. Ullr felt shame, but he turned them away. If he shared his stores with every man who asked, soon he would be the one knocking on doors. Ullr didn’t understand the hearts of these men. He didn’t understand that if they could not take what was his, they would settle to destroy it. When Ullr returned from a long day of wood cutting he saw far more smoke than usual rising from the direction of his home. He came to see the house burned, Sigyn and the boy were lost. The mob that still stood around were not pleased with their work, nor were they horrified by what they had done. Neither were they surprised as Ullr and his axe cut each one of them down.<br><br>(1/3)",,17502349,,,,,lit

He left with his home still aflame, carrying nothing but his axe and his heavy heart. He did not trust himself to walk through town, so he set off North, to the city of Bryll, the home of the king, and the center of the world.<br><br>King Lif, himself a descendent of the Gods, called for fighting men from across the world when the long winter began. Ullr did not hear the call in his far-flung village, but any who saw his broad form on the road to Bryll knew that would be his ultimate purpose. The ten thousand were fitted with sacred golden armor, long spears, and God-killing axes, they were each given a flask of a thick syrup that would keep them fed and full and warm and strong, the flasks slowly replenished themselves provided one never drank the last drop. <br><br>They marched not as an army, but in bands of ten. Ullr and his 9 companions were some of the last to leave. They started strong and brave, but as they moved north confidence shattered. They started encountering wounded men and deserters, starving families holding up golden helmets or empty flasks, begging for food. Three of his band tried to desert, the first was successful but the next two were killed by Ullr before they could escape.<br><br>Their destination was the Northern Wastes, the kingdom of The Grey. As they approached they found their minds under attack. Violent thoughts, deep despair, hit them in waves...the syrup would keep the whispers at bay, but some in his band had already exhausted their flasks desperate to stop the madness from overtaking them.<br><br>They joined up with the main body of the army, still two-thousand in number. Every day they pushed further into the frozen wastes, closer to the massive ash tree that was the source of The Grey’s strength. Every night they would try to hold their ground against the creatures He sent to attack them. Formless, shifting beasts with jagged claws and endless jaws, there was little they could do beyond killing them before they came close. It was terrifying and exhausting, the syrup wore off quickly now, leaving them vulnerable from without and within. They had to fight desperately to keep the creatures at bay or they would rip the men to shreds. Men who fell at night soon rose again as shades of themselves, hacking through comrades and camps, eyes black and unseeing they disappeared in the morning with the rest of the enemy.<br><br>(2/3)",,17502349,,,,,lit

More died and fewer came to replace them. The violent slaughter of both beasts and his former comrades became like chopping wood. It was all just or practice, as the God’s tree was now in sight!<br><br>Fewer than one hundred remained, all men like Ullr. Their armor showed no sign it was ever gold under the thick layer of dried gore. They had been sending bands back to pick through the old corpses for fresh weapons and un-drained flasks (now completely full). They had been storing these for their last push.<br><br>The last morning the hundred men each downed five full flasks of the golden syrup. Their eyes shone white with the godly power, and for the first time in memory their minds were clear with purpose. They charged at the Grey’s tree in a single great burst, hacking at it’s great base as the ground itself seemed to pull them down into it. Ullr saw a head, eyes still burning white disappear into the roots, he just kicked the helmet aside and went about his grim task.<br><br>With a great crack, the tree split. It fell impossibly slow, breaking up as it drifted down, but when it hit the ground with a huge thunder it split the earth. Ullr saw a deep green escape the tree, and felt a new voice in his head.<br><br>“You have done it, Ullr, you have ended the winter and I will now bring spring” <br><br>“It is too late” he thought “the world is dead, my family is lost. The cycle of seasons has been broken.”<br><br>He heard The Green’s light laughter in his mind. “Nothing has been broken, am I not the God of new beginnings? What you see is just the annual dance. Each year, the Grey believes he has conquered the world and each year I am freed to restore it”<br><br>And then with a bright flash he sees The Green clear away the splinters of the broken ash and plant a seed where it once stood. She lifted the dead men and beasts and restored their golden armor and white fangs. She pulled the smoke from the air and reformed the trees in the forest. Then Ullr’s world collapsed in on itself...<br><br>Ullr returned home after chopping wood. Tiny buds peaking from the trees, birds trilling, and a small tail of smoke coming from his chimney in the distance. He thanked the Gods, it seems that winter would be brief this year.",,17502349,,,,,lit

While Martin didn’t have their talent, he did share their habitual drug use and vain desire for an early grave.<br><br>Moving his bags and drum kit from his fifth-floor apartment to the box truck was the hardest thing he’d ever done. He was frostbitten and wind-scraped by the end of it and just as cold as when he’d started. The truck provided little relief. The leather driver’s seat was covered in frost that stuck to Martin’s jeans and chilled his legs worse than the wind. He grimaced and turned the key. Nothing happened. He furrowed his brow in confusion and turned the key a second time. All was silent. The engine didn’t even try. Outside, a pair of homeless men ran silently down the empty sidewalk. There was an unusual lack of ambient noise. He yanked off the thick blanket covering Squid’s cage and found his rabbit shivering in a ball. He tucked Squid under his sweater and gave a long sigh.<br><br>Squid’s fur was comforting against his chest, but he still cried. The salty drops rolled down his chin and trickled onto his neck. Squid took notice and poked his head out of Martin’s sweater to lick them up.<br><br>The sky was gray and darkening. They needed to move and find shelter. But when Martin exited the truck, the ungodly wind cut to his heart and seized it. Squid shivered violently against his chest. Each heartbeat came fainter than the last. Martin opened the back of the truck and waded into his luggage, throwing boxes and bags aside until he retrieved a leather purse. He collapsed on the spot and tugged on the metal zipper. It was stuck or frozen and wouldn’t come undone.<br><br>Squid sniffed the cold air with his frost-nipped nose and wriggled out of Martin’s sweater. The corner of the purse came apart with a few nips. It was enough for Martin to slip two fingers inside and close them around a pill decorated with a smiley face. Martin popped it into his mouth and crunched as Squid squirmed back under his sweater. A minute passed and synthetic strength surged in his bloodstream. He laughed and shot up from his slump, startling a vagrant who was peering into the back of the truck. The man had a rough face turned rosy red from the extreme cold.<br><br>Martin ran and shoved one of the pills against his lips. The vagrant chomped it down and closed his eyes, prepared to spend his last moments in bliss. Martin slapped him out of it. “Come on, man! Give me a hand.”",,17502349,,,,,lit

Faced with the reality of death, he possesses nothing, not even &#039;his&#039; life. Everything is given to him and can be taken away at any time. Such an existence is unfree, degrading and meaningless. Therefore, the goal of a mortal being must be to overcome death and become immortal. The cause of mortality is the dependence on nature, more precisely, the irrational, chaotic state in which it exists. It is necessary to overcome this dependence by recognizing and directing, i.e. by &quot;regulating&quot; (reguljacija), by &quot;bringing will and reason into nature&quot; (ynesenie vprirodu voli i razuma). By completely regulating himself and the outer nature and transforming it into a work of art, man eliminates all separation, destruction and transitoriness and therefore all limitation in space and time.",,17508276,,,,,lit

They both so far surpass anyone else in their field that they will be remembered 1,000 years from now as a kind of yin and yang of fantasy, a Manichean duality of speculative letters. For every sublime, luminous beauty that Tolkien has gifted the world, Martin has cursed us with a tedious, banal ugliness. It is unfair to compare the two directly on any one point, because Martin is in every way the anti-Tolkien, patently sterile, parasitical, and inferior, but so much so that he becomes a monument in his own right, and counterbalances Tolkien. Could one exist without the other?<br><br>Tolkien obviously could. But it is only by the contrast that Martin offers that we can truly appreciate the full depths and heights of Tolkien. Our understanding of Tolkien would be incomplete if Martin had never set pen to page. It is through only the abject failure and futility of Martin that we can approach an apprehension of the true scope and scale of Tolkien&#039;s hitherto inconceivable greatness. Perhaps this is what Tolkien had in mind when he wrote about the Music of the Ainur. If Tolkien is a subcreator in the image of Eru, truly Martin is like unto Melkor. It is only reflected in the awfulness of the one that we can fully see the goodness of the other.<br><br>Whereas with Martin we have &quot;Sunset found her squatting in the grass etc.&quot; to Tolkien we have “Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men, doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. One Ring to rule them all etc.&quot; and “Roads Go Ever On etc.&quot;, I wonder if future scholars will study the contrast and literary relationship between the two authors.",,17504303,,,,,lit

You’re fundamentally talking about the creation of Myth and motif which strikes at the universal aspects of human experience. I’ve contemplated this before and this is related to fantasy but not the sum of it.<br><br>The question is one of universality, we must admit the elder myths and folklore by their natures had characters who were more hollow, but this wasn’t a bad thing, their hollowness was intentional to produce abstract unity, that deeper shared common human experience and grand motifs creation, similarly simpler more universal themes are more essential and necessary to this. But fantasy if we go by the self defined definitions of its earliest phases while yes rooted in folk lore and mythology, it is not simply modern folk lore and modern mythology. Fantasy has as much root in the golden ass and Ovid as it does in Aesop, so also does it root in the faery Queene, midsummer’s night dream, Gawain and the green Knight, and yes while grant Macdonald is key to the beginning of what we call genre fantasy it is incorrect to say his highly moral works are more myth and fantasy with Pure abstractions in the sense of say, Aesop’s characters are.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with “deeper”(more universal abstract human experiences and truths) nor is there anything wrong with emotion, sentimentality or the like, nor is there anything wrong with the world building and crafting. If I look to Tolkien the key is Sub-genesis, if I look to Dunsany I once more see creation of an entire world dedicated to those same beautiful ideas. Fantasy is nothing more in my eyes than taking this entire world and submerging it into your imaginative powers and rebirthing it into the image of your imagination and all of the greatest fantasy writers have done precisely this. The world building isn’t bad, it’s world building for its own sake because it’s “cool” that’s bad. World building is literally Demiurgy, you can through the structure of the world you craft demonstrate any philosophical conception whether universe or particular, deep or shallow. You can claim fantasy is otherwise but that’s not really true to the history of it. Example I keep bringing up Dunsany, Dunsany never had an overarching good vs evil theme, he was a pessimist and some of his works could work as atheistic propaganda, other as explorations of entirely different religions, some moral lessons about the need of man to reunite with nature.

Anyway, because of this there is no actual value to be found in literary fiction as it has absolutely nothing to say that is true as the mental states it seeks to explore as part of the human condition have no basis in reality, so we find fantasy more authentic in its obvious synthetic nature, and presentation of worlds where mental states can be attributed to some non-materialist explanation. <br>People find this immensely gratifying because the world that science is increasingly revealing isn&#039;t one that there was any evolutionary need to comprehend, so it doesn&#039;t check off the little heuristic boxes that a predatory savannah ape needs to easily orient themselves in the world. <br><br>This all runs in tandem with the geo-political concept of end of history. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;&gt;It isn&#039;t meant to be literary</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;It is</span><br>To its detriment, as explained above. <br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;&gt;it is meant to sate certain human impulses that find no outlet in the modern world</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Never the goal</span><br>Always the impulse.

Now, modern people, whether they agree with this or not, always talk of it as a new and unheard-of idea. It is calmly and persistently supposed that the great writers of the past, say Shakespeare for instance, did not hold this view, because they had never imagined it; because it had never come into their heads. Turn up the last act of Shakespeare’s Richard III and you will find not only all that Nietzsche had to say put into two lines, but you will find it put in the very words of Nietzsche. Richard Crookback says to his nobles:<br><br>Conscience is but a word that cowards use,<br>Devised at first to keep the strong in awe.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;As I have said, the fact is plain. Shakespeare had thought of Nietzsche and the Master Morality; but he weighed it at its proper value and put it in its proper place. Its proper place is the mouth of a half-insane hunchback on the eve of defeat. This rage against the weak is only possible in a man morbidly brave but fundamentally sick; a man like Richard, a man like Nietzsche. This case alone ought to destroy the absurd fancy that these modern philosophies are modern in the sense that the great men of the past did not think of them.

His solution to this predicament is to simply say &quot;ah, but that&#039;s exactly what I knew you would say, that by itself is evidence of what I&#039;m saying&quot;. And so you spin in circles where every objection you could ever want to make against Nietzsche is always already pre-determined as a case in his favor in his system of thought. For some reason this general movement of argument became very popular at that time, for example Marxists suffer from a very similar thing with false consciousness or by blaming capital as sort of a all-powerful Other where even completely disjointed things are somehow traced back to the root of capital. I&#039;m not sure what happened around that time, but this kind of irrational ideological thing started becoming very prevalent at that time. Even in things supposedly very anti-Nietzschean such as decolonisation or white privilege or whatever one discovers this kernel of Nietzsche in that they will not even establish a framework for rational discussion of things, because like for Nietzsche the intellect itself is already pre-contaminated by some kind of will to power. Nietzscheans would like to absolve Nietzsche from this because he would be very much against your contemporary SJW but in reality they both operate on the same irrational anti-metaphysical basis.",,17508182,,,,,lit

Somebody needs to say this amid all the fanfare and rhetorics.",,17508182,,,,,lit

It is like those who thought the point of Fight Club was to fight and destroy shit. Nietzsche had inspired some of the greatest thinkers and artists of the 20th century. These people were not stupid nor juvenile. <br>The juvenile readings are often not wrong, but just limited. His writings often have multiple meanings, so even if you have a reading that is not wrong per se, it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s the whole truth. I&#039;ve seen it before also with a christcuck on this board who had a valid perspective on will to power, but absolutely seethed at the idea that there was more to it than his interpretation, because all he wanted to do was to &quot;refute&quot;, as if refutation of a philosophy of the kind that Nietzsche writes is even possible. <br><br>An example of what I&#039;m thinking of is the concept of the Overman from TSZ. The juvenile reading of the Overman is individualistic, might is right, egoist. This is not necessarily a wrong interpretation, but it is the least interesting, in my opinion. The Overman is also a social idea, the idea that the meaning of humanity can be achieved by emergence, that humanity can justify itself by achieving something beyond itself. The Overman is the antithesis to the Last Man. It is an imperative, a call to action that is both social and personal, to strive to create meaning, purpose, life, both for ourselves as persons and as a society. It is fundamentally a call to struggle agaisnt the forces of nihilism and despair. If you only focus on the juvenile interpration, you lose this understanding of Overman. <br><br>The thing is, there is a fundametal tension in most of what Nietzsche writes between romanticism and cynicism, nihilism and anti-nihilism, etc. I think this is well encapsulated in his short essay &#039;On the Pathos of Truth&#039;, where he displays his ability to earnestly produce two well-argumented positions in direct opposition to each other. This is also why much of his writing is so fascinating. And finally, this is why it is very possible to read and learn from Nietzsche, even as a Christian. He has much to teach, and much to inspire Christians with. I&#039;m sure many Christians have done so. But to do that, you&#039;d have to approach him in good faith. Most christcucks immediatly think the equivalent of ORANGE BAD MAN when his name is brought up, probably because they&#039;ve always been Christians and someone once told them that Nietzsche was the great atheist philosopher or something, and thus they decided to hate him, without knowing him.",,17508182,,,,,lit

Its not just &quot;memes&quot; or &quot;banter&quot;, its vicious attacking, and regardless of intentions it does demean people and hurt feelings. I can&#039;t say I&#039;m the only Nietzschean who finds it hard to take pride in his own Ubermensch after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my power from insecure losers here.

I, on the other hand, have positive ideals: I admire Alcibiades, and the Emperor Frederick II, and Napoleon. For the sake of such men, any misery is worth while.

True, it includes a negative element, the absence of suffering; but it has in addition quiet as much that is positive as it to be found in your doctrine. Though I have no special admiration for Alcibiades and Napoleon, I, too, have my heroes: my successor Jesus, because he told men to love their enemies; the men who discovered how to master the forces of nature and secure food with less labour; the medical men who have shown how to diminish disease; the poets and artists and musicians who have caught glimpses of the Divine beatitude. Love and knowledge and delight in beauty are not negations; they are enough to fill the lives of the greatest men that have ever lived.&quot;</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;&quot;All the same,&quot; Nietzsche replies, &quot;your world would be insipid. You should study Heraclitus, whose works survive complete in the celestial library. Your love is compassion, which is elicited by pain; your truth, if you are honest, is unpleasant, and only to be known through suffering; and as to beauty, what is more beautiful than the tiger, who owes his splendour to his fierceness? No, if the Lord should decide for your world, I fear we would all die of boredom.&quot; &quot;You might,&quot; Buddha replies, &quot;because you love pain, and your love of life is a sham. But those who really love life would be happy as no one can be happy in the world as it is.&quot;</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;For my part, I agree with Buddha as I have imagined him. But I do not know how to prove that he is right by any argument such as can be used in a mathematical or a scientific question. I dislike him Nietzsche because he likes the contemplation of pain, because he erects conceit into a duty, because the men whom he most admires are conquerors, whose glory is cleverness in causing men to die. But I think the ultimate argument against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally self-consistent ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal to emotions. Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive power to all that I desire as regards the world. His followers have had their innings, but we may hope that it is coming rapidly to an end.</span>",,17506242,,,,,lit

If the nature of the world and of knowledge of the world were ONLY solvere, there would be no force pulling you (even now) to some future coagulare. <br><br>What do you know? You know you&#039;re really in this bitch, you know you&#039;re you. You don&#039;t know what that you is, but you know it. You know that nothing in your ordinary knowledge is permanent, that when you doubt all the way down to the bottom, it&#039;s possible to find that there isn&#039;t even a bottom, that the essence of ordinary knowledge is movement and change, not stability. But certain things don&#039;t change. You are still there, even amidst all the movement with no stability. And you feel yourself pulled, even when posting this thread, to something beyond the flux, to some stability that doesn&#039;t dissolve, like all the ordinary bits of knowledge you have tried out so far. <br><br>What do you think inspired Socrates and Plato? Was it the natural philosophy or proto-science Anaxagoras or Thales? No, it was Heraclitus, because Heraclitus brought the problem of flux to its highest point, practically daring anyone who came after him to find a way to designate something stable in the flux, when even their very designations would have to take place WITHIN that flux, and thus could not be stable. That is why flux is a paradox. Socrates and Plato didn&#039;t retreat away from Heraclitus&#039; articulation of flux as the only manifest fact of the world, they embraced it, but put emphasis on MANIFEST. I said above, &quot;ordinary knowledge,&quot; not knowledge. The discovery of flux, of sceptical regress and free fall, is indeed a decisive blow to the stability of ordinary, manifest knowledge. And this discovery initially causes a feeling of vertigo. But instead of trying to retreat from the vertigo, Socrates and Plato observed that there are forces and inclinations still pulling on us even when we seem to doubt everything else. Even when we can&#039;t discursively demonstrate something with certainty, we have a priori ideas of certainty. Even when we can&#039;t discursively demonstrate morality, even when all of our inquiries into morality terminate in nihilism and aporia, we still feel a fragment of &quot;the&quot; moral within us. <br><br>The more we follow this fragment, which is not itself discursive but a sort of law or north star &quot;governing&quot; all of our particular, discursive articulations of it, the better, or more &quot;adequate&quot; our discursive articulations become, and the more we seem to feel and even see something behind and beyond the manifest and the ordinary. <br><br>Discursive knowledge is a tool. Even mathematical proofs are expressed in this language. Complacent minds never question the parameters or the &quot;why&quot; of their pre-give ntools. Slightly stronger minds realise the contingency of their tools but never seek beyond that, assuming the nature of nature is raw contingency. Wise minds ask &quot;Who made the tools? In the image of what, or of whom, are the tools made?&quot;",,17509792,,,,,lit

When he, who through the methods of clairvoyance discloses the super-sensible reality, now approaches this reality with his concepts, he will thus find the network of concepts coincides just as much with the super-sensible world. From the other side the super-sensible reality throws its rays as it were on the network of concepts, as on the one side does the sensible reality.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Now whence comes this network of concepts itself? Here that can only be asserted as fact, for the answer to this question can only result as the consequence of the logical path which we shall yet be able to take together. Today I will only give you a picture of this network of concepts, in order to show whence the network, which a man weaves within him, takes it origin. That is best made clear by a shadow picture. The shadow-picture of the hand would never arise if the hand were not there. The shadow-picture resembles its prototype, but it has one peculiarity! it is nothing! Through the fact that in the place of light the non-light comes, through the partial occluding of the light the shadow-picture comes into being. The concepts arise in exactly the same way, through the fact that behind our thinking soul there stands the super-sensible reality.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;The concepts also are really only an obliteration of the super-sensible reality, and because they resemble the spiritual world, as the shadow-pictures do the prototypes, for this reason the human being can form an inkling of the super-sensible worlds. When the perception of the super-sensible makes concept with the sensible, then these shadow-pictures arise. In the conceptual shadow-pictures you have the super-sensible reality just as little as in the shadow-picture of the hand you have the hand itself. Accordingly we have recognized here that the concepts are the boundary between the two realities, but originate from the super-sensible reality.</span>",,17509792,,,,,lit

So then, when re-reading once the high wore off I can see more clearly what is good and what is bad about my writing. I remember rereading a journal I kept in 2018 where the premise was that I would write an entry every day to kick-start myself into discipline and high achiever-dom. There was this weirdly sober but naive quality of confidence within it, which was then punctuated by entries that came about because I neglected to write for a few days or weeks. The entries that came after not doing it for some time were so angry and shameful but also cathartic.

Even the most shallow dive into history reveals that emulating past trends and reviving old traditions and attempting to recapture some lost age imagined to be more enlightened is incredible common in all cultures throughout history. I mean, just look at how beards are popular among East Orthodox Christian priests whereas catholic priests are all clean shaven. It wasn’t always this way. Catholic priests started to normalize clean shaven faces in the early medieval as a way to recapture the Roman ideal, whereas beards were gradually seen as “eastern” and “alien” in priests. Beards were slowly otherized as East orthodox after the schism and eventually many of the tropes referring to a “foreign, bearded enemy of Catholicism” was transferred into anti Semitic tropes which only became solidified into a coherent stereotype well into the medieval era. Romans would try to mimic Greeks, Protestants sought to return to a “true Christianity before catholic tradition built up”, and Wahhabism seeks to restore “early Islam” and was in many ways an Arab cope to the fact that nonarabic Turkish and Persian states dominated much of the Islamic world at the time.",,17510828,,,,,lit

For every Gene Wolfe or J. G. Ballard or Jack Vance, there are dozens of authors of generically competent prose — and three or four utter hacks. Lafferty was a stylist, and an unusual one. Not for Lafferty is Wolfe’s ornate reflection, Ballard’s shellshocked precision, or Vance’s prickly eloquence. The closest analogue might be the overheated, colloquial, manic, and allusive voice of David R. Bunch’s Moderan stories, with the caveats that Lafferty is less angry, less grim, and more fun. British science fiction luminary Brian Aldiss imagined the Moderan tales as a posthumous collaboration between “Whitman and Nietzsche,” and no such comparison would serve Raphael Aloysius Lafferty. Though he was as American as Whitman, Lafferty was no Nietzsche: he never doubted that God remained alive.</span><br><br>Can I get a based check on Lafferty?",,17510697,,,,,lit
