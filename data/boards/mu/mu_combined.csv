You can&#039;t hear pick noises or natural harmonics quite as well, they don&#039;t buzz or have any uniqueness to them. So for me, I&#039;ve switched to basically a les paul style guitar with p90s because I can go from really heavy tones to almost clean by just changing my picking dynamics, and I get a ton of pick noise, natural harmonics, and feedback. I also went from preferring low action high speed low drag to high action just cause it makes you put that little bit more effort into your playing that comes through on a recording. It&#039;s like the difference between listening to eddie van halen who played on a partscaster with high action and satriani. There&#039;s a certain grit that comes with a playing a guitar that isn&#039;t as easy to play.",,,,,,,,1613003640,,,101539313,,,,,,,101539313,,,,,,mu

Now, I wasn’t used to that kind of shit back then— I was hardly even drinking, I think I had just started smoking— and I definitely wasn’t into drugs yet because I was only nineteen years old and hadn’t seen no shit like that before. Anyway, Bird noticed that I was getting kind of uptight with the woman sucking all over his dick and everything, and him sucking on her pussy. So he asked if something was wrong with me, and if his doing this was bothering me. When I told him that I felt uncomfortable with them doing what they were doing in front of me, with her licking and slapping her tongue like a dog all over his dick and him making all that moaning noise in between taking bites of chicken, I told him, “Yeah, it’s bothering me.” So you know what that motherfucker said? He told me that if it was bothering me, then I should turn my head and not pay attention I couldn’t believe that shit, that he actually said that to me. The cab was real small and we all three were in the backseat, so where was I supposed to turn m head?

I don’t know if I should be telling this. Well, O.K., so Spencer and I were writing together in his apartment in the East Village one afternoon–and Spencer spoke liberally to me about his experiences with Morrissey, that he’s kind of an intense, strange person, and there are rumors that he’s a racist–not that I really believe it, maybe he just uses racist remarks to shock or whatever. Or maybe I’m just still a fan and I’m creating excuses for him. Anyway, at that stage in Morrissey’s life–this was the late 90s–he was big into faxing. It’s very ominous, faxing. I mean, there’s this big, scary machine sitting there and suddenly it just beeps and the grr grr grr of the paper coming through, it’s really a little frightening! So Spencer and I are writing a song together and off goes the fax machine in the other room. And Spencer goes in there and it’s Morrissey faxing to see if he can use this song that he and Spencer wrote together. I think Morrissey owed Spencer money then and things were all out of sorts. So Spencer faxes him back and says, you know, sorry mate but I don’t think that’d be best until we’ve got all the rights sorted out, et cetera, et cetera. And he comes back into the living room and he and I are pling-plonging away on our guitars. Then, after a little while, we hear beep! grrrrr grrrrr grrrrr and we both look at each other and Spencer goes in to get the fax, and he comes back with this piece of paper in his hands and in big, black letters scrolled across the page it reads, ‘YOUR LOSS JEW BOY.’ It was like a death threat the way it looked! (laughs) Poor Spencer, he was just devastated. He’s very sensitive, too. I think after that he and I just went to a bar, did some drugs, drank beer for ten hours.</span>",,,,,,,,1613003049,,,101532240,,,,,,,101532240,,,,,,mu

Jackson was performing his hit &quot;Earth Song&quot; while surrounded by children and a rabbi. Cocker and his friend Peter Mansell (a former Pulp member) performed an impromptu stage invasion in protest.</span><br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Cocker was detained and interviewed by the police on suspicion of assault. He was accompanied by comedian Bob Mortimer, a former solicitor, who represented him in that capacity. He was subsequently released without charge. Opinions from the press on Cocker&#039;s actions were mixed. Melody Maker&#039;s edition of 2 March 1996, for example, suggested Cocker should be knighted, and Noel Gallagher of Oasis said that &quot;Jarvis Cocker is a star&quot; and should be awarded an MBE. Blur frontman Damon Albarn did not approve of Cocker&#039;s actions, stating that he found it &quot;really disturbing&quot; when Cocker &quot;pulled his pants down&quot; in front of Jackson. &quot;He&#039;s got some very odd ideas about reality&quot;, Albarn added on Cocker&#039;s actions, &quot;I think it’s a collective responsibility to say ‘No you can’t go and do what you’re doing’, not just to ridicule him&quot;. Though the media described Cocker&#039;s stunt as &quot;mooning Jackson&quot;, Cocker denied it, saying that he merely turned his bottom waving. Jackson himself stated on the incident, I&#039;m sickened, saddened, shocked, upset, cheated and angry, but immensely proud that the cast remained professional and the show went on.[19][20] Regarding his actions, Cocker said, &quot;My actions were a form of protest at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing. I just ran on the stage. I didn&#039;t make any contact with anyone as far as I recall.&quot;</span>",,,,,,,,1613004810,,,101532240,,,,,,,101532240,,,,,,mu

She seemed as though she was trying to resurrect the ennui and decadence of Weimar, pre-Hitler Germany. Her icy, Nordic image also added to the detachment of her delivery. (...) The audience was on her side, as she was in her element and the Warhol contingent was very prominent that night. &gt;However, what happened next is what sticks in my mind the most from that night. In between sets, Frank Zappa got up from his seat and walked up on the stage and sat behind the keyboard of Nico&#039;s B-3 organ. He proceeded to place his hands indiscriminately on the keyboard in a total, atonal fashion and screamed at the top of his lungs, doing a caricature of Nico&#039;s set, the one he had just seen. The words to his impromptu song were the names of vegetables like broccolli, cabbage, asparagus... This &quot;song&quot; kept going for about a minute or so and then suddenly stopped. He walked off the stage and the show moved on.

The works he preferred, as a dichotomy with his loathed jazz, was modernist composition, specifically at times citing the compositions of Schoenberg. This music insists on attention, education, and is too strange to a mass audience&#039;s ears to be commodified. Modernist compositions are inherently academic exercises attempting to expand the language of music itself, rather than truly meant to be listened to.<br><br>Adorno was right about one thing, however: desires are always conditioned from somewhere, and he was right to say that capital was rapidly becoming our primary cultural conditioner. His point was Confucius-esque: if we all must learn, why not let our men of high culture teach? Having been raised well into the neoliberal imperial period, my teacher is and always has been the Top 40, which is the most condensed version of the standardization and repetition in music that Adorno feared.

You have no idea what you are talking about or you are grasping at straws to keep a shitty marketing narrative for some reason. There is no way Pearl Jam are anything like Soundgarden. The music isnt sludgey its blues rock. Why are you doing this? Do you need attention? Pearl Jam and Nirvana sound nothing alike. Enjoying the same morning ceral and cartoons has nothing to do with musical genres you absolute braindead fool.

I don&#039;t watch SNL or even really know who this person is so I figured maybe they had a point. Now that I&#039;ve read through this thread - holy shit. Reached out to the guitar company for FUCKING PERMISSION, given a fake monitor to destroy, and did what has to be the most pathetic attempt ever at smashing a guitar on live television. And no, not because she was a woman, because she genuinely looks scared for those first few seconds before she swings it, and even when she does it she looks terrified and like it&#039;ll swing back and hit her in the face. The way the guitar looks like its heavy for her to hold. The lame ass, winded kick she gives that barely moves the monitor an inch away. There is no emotion or energy behind it. It&#039;s feels so fake, planned, manufactured and shit, it&#039;s like the least &quot;rock and roll&quot; thing ever.",,,,,,,,1612937162,,,101520398,,,,,,,101520398,,,,,,mu

Which takes away a lot of potential force. You want to hold poles on one end, which then puts all the power on the other end. Holding it in the middle balances the power out.<br><br>Also, she&#039;s moving her body with the guitar. Again, a lot of force comes from maximizing leverage. And so you do that by swinging from your shoulders. Which again, puts all the force on the opposite end, which is the end of the guitar you&#039;re holding. But by teetering at the waist, she&#039;s actually helping support the guitar and reducing the potential force it has.<br><br>I know my explanation sounds dumb. Because I forgot all the terms for this stuff. I&#039;m not scientist. But we all learned a thing or two about physics in high school, right? And if you didn&#039;t learn it in science, then you learned it in the gym. Because this is important to know for sports. It&#039;s the essence of throwing and swinging and all that. This is basically what they were trying to teach us in school.<br><br>You can tell that she never played outside as a kid.

Whether they disband or extend, the result will both shock the fans and antisㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ<br><br>9. But did they ever tell us who were rigged?<br><br>10.

It was always SOMEWHAT for the weird crowd, always somewhat geared toward an aspect of nicheness even when it was hugest. Why does that matter or have to do with file sharing you ask?<br><br>Because, think of it this way. You&#039;re a record company, you have no plans of leaving the music business, this is your bread and butter, the only thing you know and you&#039;ve never planned for anything else in live and probably still are fairly rich, but you now realize the money you make has been cut into a quarter of what it once was. The first thing you&#039;re going to do, is cut out the &quot;fat&quot; whatever that may be, and focus only on A. the stuff that brings in the absolute biggest bucks and has the MOST mass appeal across borders (pop music) and B. focus on the stuff that is popular but maybe a little more niche but is cheapest to produce and put on tour en masse (rap music). Rock bands just aren&#039;t worth it to major labels these days to promote. Also, notice how exactly the timeline lines up for when rock bands stopped being promoted by major labels and also the phenomenon of popstars and rappers starting to be dressed like rockers and marketed towards &quot;outsider&quot; demographics? It&#039;s no coincidence, the labels are attempting to make up for the loss they knew they took by drawing as much of the rock crowd into these other things they can.<br><br>Nothing that is big in mainstream music is incidental, it all comes down to major labels investing in them and promoting them, you have exceptions to the rule here and there, but generally, it&#039;s all about how big of a billboard you can buy.",,,,,,,,1612991638,,,101533599,,,,,,,101533599,,,,,,mu

I guarantee there would be no difference from the 2000s to right now in popular music if pirating music didn&#039;t become the defacto way to get it. The major labels are not music fans, they&#039;re businessmen. The underground or more fan based labels haven&#039;t changed....did Nuclear Blast shift to rap music? No, but you were never going to be a superstar on Nuclear Blast, you were going to be a popular niche artist.<br><br>I don&#039;t see how it is victim blaming at all, yeah like people who are rock fans are victims in a sense, but they created their own hell, I&#039;m one of them. It&#039;s because no consequences came to pirating....I pirated, I still do all the time, I also pirate movies and books and those formats are also suffering because of it. Why do you think Hollywood is only about popcorn flicks with tons of CGI? Because those movies are the only ones that entice people to go to the theater to get the full experience of seeing the effects, can&#039;t take chances on anything now....I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m holier than though or anything nor am I saying record company people are angels but it ultimately does come down to the fact that they make substantially less money on music than they used to. Just think about pop music, how many fucking rip offs of the Backstreet Boys were there? There were dozens of them, they signed any band of pretty boys who could sing and be taught to dance.....how many Billie Eilishes are there?

I should now like to call my most delicate and profound art the art of transition [(Übergang, also translated to as &quot;crossing,&quot; and always relates to being between two points)], for the whole fabric of my art is made up of such transitions: all that is abrupt and sudden is now repugnant to me; it is often unavoidable and necessary, but even then it may not occur unless the mood has been clearly prepared in advance so that the suddenness of the transition appears to come as a matter of course. My greatest masterpiece in the art of the most delicate and gradual transition is without doubt the great scene in the second act of Tristan and Isolde. The opening of this scene presents a life overflowing with all the most violent emotions — its ending the most solemn and heartfelt longing for death. These are the pillars: and now you see, child, how I have joined these pillars together, and how the one of them leads over into the other. This, after all, is the secret of my musical form, which, in its unity and clarity over an expanse that encompasses every detail, I may be bold enough to claim has never before been dreamt of. If only you knew how that guiding emotion has inspired me to invent musical devices that would never have occurred to me previously (devices in terms of rhythm, as well as harmonic and melodic development), you would realize that even in the most specialized branches of art no truth is ever invented that does not derive from such grand primary motives. That, then, is art!</span>",,,,,,,,1612887942,,,101507461,,,,,,,101507461,,,,,,mu

I started with solo piano stuff and worked my way up to string quartets and symphonies. Chopin and Satie were the first two composers I really got into because their music doesn&#039;t have a lot of development or anything along the way, which makes it easier to wrap your head around with just 1 or 2 listens.

It&#039;s tempting to play proper compositions immediately because you might already well be able to play the correct notes, but you won&#039;t learn to play it musically and will also hinder your progress on sight-reading significantly (you will be just memorizing them painstakingly).<br>Go slow and buy some good beginner&#039;s book and stick to really really simple pieces first. After a while you can mix in pieces from the Anna Magdalena book, Bartok&#039;s &quot;for children&quot; etc. but keep on playing the simple pieces from the beginner&#039;s book. If you can&#039;t make these simple pieces sound clean and musical you won&#039;t be able to do it for more difficult stuff.",,,,,,,,1612951096,,,101507461,,,,,,,101507461,,,,,,mu

I too feel this sense of holding back and always restraining the music, but for me that&#039;s part of his charm as he stands out against the exuberance of the german-style composers while being not as loose as the french-style composers comopsers. <br>Maybe check out his piano quintet, string quartet and his trios, they&#039;re my favourites.

You don&#039;t have to listen to a lot of Mozart to derive pleasure from listening to him, but if you play Scriabin&#039;s late piano sonatas to a random everyman he will be left dumbfounded and not in a positive way. For me it&#039;s Brahms, he just can&#039;t seem to click unless I actually play his music, with lots of rehearsals, slowly getting to analyze every single melody and chord, in which case it&#039;s the most beautiful music ever composed. Anyway, back to the topic, maybe you&#039;re listening to works of his which are too personal. Have you listened to the Symphony in d yet?",,,,,,,,1612987849,,,101507461,,,,,,,101507461,,,,,,mu

Bridges of course are the most common place to do this because they&#039;re meant to be a switch-up. Modulating up by a 4th is most common (Sunny Side of the Street, A Train, Miss Jones (however briefly it alights upon the 4th lol), etc.)<br><br>When talking bebop and beyond, generally I wouldn&#039;t say there&#039;s so much a logic behind key changes in that sense. It&#039;s just about crafting a novel melody and chord sequence. <br><br>Also could be noted: bebop started out mostly as contrafacts of pop tunes. Beboppers would take those more basic changes and &quot;jazzify&quot; them so that they conformed more to the logic of jazz -- basically making everything they could into a 2-5 of some sort. Think of it like &quot;streamlining&quot; -- it would make comping and soloing easier because things would be more interchangeable. This often meant changing color chords like diminished chords into ii-Vs (for example, the A-7 to D7 in bars 3-4 of Groovin&#039; High, originally simply a Ebdim in Whispering). While this would give the impression of the key having changed, really, it&#039;s just an extrapolated color chord, or passing chords of sorts. Sometimes these passing chords would become somewhat long digressions because the predicament was created of returning, in a functional manner, to the &quot;actual&quot; key.<br><br>Later when people started writing their own compositions in &quot;the bebop style&quot;, they took these practices and made them an essential tenet of the compositions themselves. The digressions became even longer and the changes more frenetic.<br><br>Hope that helps answer your question.",,,,,,,,1613003795,,,101492498,,,,,,,101492498,,,,,,mu
