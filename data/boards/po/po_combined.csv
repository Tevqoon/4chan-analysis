<br>
<i>What paper should I use?</i><br>
<br>
Small models can be made with light 100 to 150 gsm paper, while large ones are better with heavy 150 to 200+ gsm paper.<br>
<br>
<i>Where do I begin with papercraft can I find easy papercrafts?</i><br>
<br>
Papercraft also requires glue, and cutting tools. A PVA glue stick is works. A pen knife and cutting board is recommended, but otherwise scissors are okay for simple models.<br>
<br>
Papercraft normally involves printing and cutting out a number of nets, and and gluing tabs and pieces where appropriate to form a model.<br>
<br>
You can find a variety of papercraft models on this board that may interest you. Ask for some otherwise, and be specific about what you would like. You can search online for ‘easy papercraft templates’, these links have many.<br>

<br>
<i>Where do I begin with origami and how can I find easy models?</i><br>
<br>
Try browsing the board for guides, or other online resources listed below, for models you like and practice folding them.<br>
<br>
A great way to begin at origami is to participate in the Let’s Fold Together threads <a href=""https://boards.4channel.org/po/catalog#s=lft""><a href=""//boards.4channel.org/po/catalog#s=lft"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;&gt;/po/lft</a></a> - open up the PDF file and find a model you like, work on it, and discuss or post results.<br>

<br>
<i>What paper should I use?</i><br>
<br>
It depends on the model; for smaller models which involved 25 steps or fewer, 15 by 15 cm origami paper from a local craft store will be suitable. For larger models you will need larger or thinner paper, possibly from online shops. Boxpleated models require thin paper, such as sketching paper. Wet folded models require thicker paper, such as elephant hide.<br>

<br>
<i>Hints and tips?</i><br>
<br>
For folding, The best advice is to always fold as cleanly as possible, and take your time. Everything else comes with experience.<br>

<br>
<i>What are ‘CPs’?</i><br>
<br>
Crease patterns are a structural representations of origami models, shown as a schematic of lines; they are essentially origami models unfolded and laid flat. Lines on a crease pattern may be indicated by ‘mountain’ or ‘valley’ folds to show how the folds alternate. If you’re particularly skilled at origami, they become useful instructions for building models. A common base fold is usually discernable, all the intermediate details can be worked on from there.<br>

I don&#039;t know if you ever folded from a complex japanese book, but they&#039;re self explanitory despite being moon runes. And then there&#039;s books like Oriol Esteve&#039;s. I respect him as a folder, but his book makes me want to punch him in the throat. His book has a lot of ambiguity, and it can tak on time just to figure things out, even more if you interpret it wrong. I&#039;d be be doing crease patterns if I want to solve a fold.<br>I&#039;m trying the lion right now. One thing I see missing from this diagram opposed to a really good diagram are well defined precreases. It might double the steps because of the way you&#039;re doing it, but I feel its worth it, because your models are really nice.<br>I might ask questions later. I&#039;m working on your lion.

Other times I have plans, but they often fall through/shift dramatically as the process goes. <br><br>This time I had an idea in mind for what I wanted, but the end result is a lot different, ie, I wanted a cute simple bumblebee, ended up with a wasp. The wasp and clione models are both just traditional bases with a grafted section in the middle. <br><br>The wasp isn&#039;t actually good at all from a design sense, since it required a large sheet of paper to make it look even remotely nice, despite the lack of limbs. The head is a sink down and then sinks to thin what is essentially the top of a bird base, so the neck looks terrible (the torso covers it though). I want to use the head in the future, but with a better base.<br><br>The torso is a grafted bird base flap turned 180 degrees around and is actually the same size as the abdomen, which will tell you how much paper I wasted just for the seamless color change. Which then didn&#039;t matter because the abdomen has a seam. <br><br>The way you described my design process is pretty spot on I suppose, there was a design thread that kinda went bust because of low involvement, but I described in great detail the thought process of my lion. I didn&#039;t star out making a lion, it was a happy accident I took advantage of. The only revision for the wasp was the head, the rest I figured out immediately.

Plus Lang is on a more technical spectrum, so his book only gives half the lesson, the other half being artistic expression. <br><br>Not that there&#039;s anything wrong with technical artists, and their work is incredible, but sometimes it&#039;s nice to see a model and think &quot;I never would&#039;ve looked at it that way&quot; or &quot;I know exactly who made this based on their unique style,&quot; and unfortunately that sort of variety in presentation appears less and less the more technically exact the model is. <br><br>Regarding your assessment of Lang and mine statements, it is absolutely necessary to learn techniques, and I genuinely think (maybe this is a biased opinion) that what techniques you prefer and how you learn them affect your growth as an artist.<br><br>If you&#039;re getting bored of Lang&#039;s book, take a break and fold something.

I like making things similar to what OP does, hell this is literally one of the common steps for making clay sculptures and people use aluminum foil and hot glue to make figures. But this is absolutely not in any way origami. Origami is the act of folding a single square of paper into a design without the use of cuts, tape/glue and all fold done can be simplified to combinations of 4 folds (mountain, valley, inside &amp; outside reverse folds). Wet folding is a variant which does not add any physical medium to the finished product and foil-paper still abides by the same rules as traditional origami. crumpling a piece of paper isn&#039;t origami, crumpling and shaping foil isn&#039;t origami.

The pits you see on my ball originate from the wrinkles in the foil when it was pressed by hand, hammering the ball closed these gaps. Either way these pits are very tiny, its just that there&#039;s a lot of them and there are small smooth spots which is surprising considering it was done with just a hammer.

Look up annealing temperatures for aluminum. You don&#039;t need to do it for 3 hours like the guides recommend since you only care about the surface. You can tell what temperature it is based on the color of its oxide layer (below 800F on this chart) or glow (all metals glow the same color at the same temps). I&#039;m not really sure which charts to trust since their numbers differ by a few hundred degrees. Annealing doesn&#039;t melt metals but it softens brittle metals by reforming the crystal grains and releasing internal stresses",Aluminum cookpot,.gif,275.0,383.0,89.0,125.0,1528081086231.0,1528081086,Ct//TN9T4AcmV01QOXbQBw==,14385.0,544301,,,,,,544301,,,,,po

It is a simple matter of perspective. Most come asking for hard to find (although most are easy to find) models, but have nothing to offer. And that is fine... but when someone asks for a model and has something to offer. An incentive, that person is the bad guy. Very strange. I see that mentality with the millennials in the world wanting to change their countries Communist. Give me free shit because I am entitled and I give nothing back. Because I draw breath, you owe me. Weird way to think. Once everybody puts their empty hands out, there will be no free shit to get. Everyone will be asking and no one will be producing and their won&#039;t be shit to give.<br><br>Got somewhere else to go to get all I have to offer, great go, and come back here and share... like everyone is preaching and ranting like a lunatic about. If someone has the model I requested, or can easily get it, do you think they are going to share it in a thread that has unnecessarily turned into this.

(I tested now, it&#039;s working right now)<br><br>If you&#039;re in the right time there, every time you log in and log out, you&#039;ll get 50 coins, so don&#039;t need waste time commenting at random there<br><br>Anyways I already did that of getting everything there months ago, but I&#039;ve been busy these days and helping someone with some magazines and booklets, try to get the coins like I&#039;ve said and download what you need, if don&#039;t work, then tell me what you want from there and I&#039;ll upload when I&#039;ve time and after I finish post the magazines/booklets",,,,,,,,1612647669,,,589462,,,,,,589462,,,,,po

Just make papercrafts share them if you want, don’t expect people to thank you but be grateful if they do, and you’ll become easier to find than an asshole seller of your papercrafts easy enough. Don’t spend your days hating but make papercrafts if that’s what you’re good at and love doing.",,,,,,,,1611510281,,,588773,,,,,,588773,,,,,po

Telling and agreeing that people should just make free papercrafts and stop being “selfish”, to just release everything for free and the designers releasing and selling them themselves are “at fault” for the crafts being stolen, not being upset that your own intellectual property is being stolen and other people taking credit for it, damn you must be Americans, there is no other way. Either that or of some low-life 3. World country where they think they are entitled to get everything for free. Where are you people even living, on what planet? What the hell are you even arguing about. Damn this community is full of lowlife idiots that are ungrateful bastards and I am sick seeing people like this being even a part of the craft community, where you don’t even appreciate ANY kind of work into making these. Pieces of scum, lowlifes. How dare you belittle designers and others what they should do with their own work. That is just like saying that we should all just start stealing everything from others, because they are “at fault” for selling thing them in the first place. Clothes shops, jewelry, self-made products all over the internet, they themselves are at “fault” for people copying and stealing their work and money for what they do. What a twisted bullcr*p. Stop freaking making papercrafts with that crap attitude of yours, not appreciating anything that gets showed in your pampered ass, parents paying for everything you are getting stuffed in your lard face, not appreciating the air you breathe. You make me sick. Thank the F*CK SV stopped sharing crafts to you retarded inbreed people on here. You don’t even deserve the dirt I would ram your face in if I even see you.

I got to designer site, logged into my account - just to find my order history empty! Designer told me that my license to files expired and if i want them, i should buy them again! There was nothing about &quot;expiring&quot; when i bought models!

Remove all unnecessary details, and then some of the kind-of necessary details on top of that. If you notice it disappear when zoomed out, keep it. Detail is a right bastard to get right, so it&#039;s often easier to smooth over into different, larger shapes. Makes the stencil easier to cut out and more stable to hold/spray around<br>2. Bridges. If you want to cut the white bit out to outline around, these are the things that keep the thing from tearing apart in your hands since you can just go over it in post. Obviously if you are just cutting into a piece to spray into the black bits, you can ignore this image, because you&#039;ll have different islands to deal with and bridge (most would be in the hair). Ideally, make the bridges obnoxiously big and connect a few points together, it makes the stencil more stable and harder to miss them when going over it post-spray. On the flipside, smaller bridges (like in the hair) are stupidly fucking tedious to get right, easier to fuck up the entire piece with a slip-but harder to notice if you get it down. Dots (like the ones attaching the hair to the face) are shit easy to do, add a nice amount of stability and are overall good calls to pepper longer stretches with (just remember they exist)<br>3. Don&#039;t forget, you are essentially free-spraying when bridging shit, so take that into consideration. Alternatively you can make another stencil with the white added to the black and the bridges as white, then spray those inwards. Be careful however, because if you get it 1mm off; it looks really fucking weird and disjointed.",helping_anon,.png,1020.0,1444.0,88.0,125.0,1534400650058.0,1534400650,3whdBwvRecraw5D7vniPJQ==,230376.0,552867,,,,,,552867,,,,,po

So, &quot;just a though&quot;, I don&#039;t give a fuck about your opinion. I asked if anybody would be willing or can download them, and my offer still stands.

You took offense by it, got butthurt, and then accused me of being butthurt. You spoke about OP&#039;s kindness in sharing after offering a trade. I&#039;ll share my rare models if and only if someone else rips this site for me, first. Furthermore, if you want to speak ONLY to OP, then perhaps you should exchange contact info and do it privately. Otherwise you were speaking to me and everyone else who passes through. Again, I was merely, like you, making an &#039;offer&#039;. If that doesn&#039;t work for you, that&#039;s ok, but being a dick about it was completely unwarranted. This is exactly why shares like OP&#039;s is a rarity. Many people who have something truly interesting to offer just quietly keep it to themselves. A complete rip of the site is unlikely. I was willing to help you out with some more specific requests, but your shit attitude cured me of that.

And I know papercolors is another and it’s slightly better but I want to know, can you find other designers taobao pages if they even exist? Some seem to be gone with their crafts out of print but I have no clue.. I remember seeing one of Junko Enoshima that me or another person mentioned earlier in the thread but looking up the designer we really don’t get anything, but wayback machine actually archived a blog showing proof of a designer, and their Taobao page being dead. I want to know if they left that community and stopped selling, or if they are operating under another name, I know a designer was linked in the baidu groups page but it’s always been dead, and these people on that group don’t link shit, they always say “this is the shop owner” mostly never saying the product name, and the Taobao shop names are usually pretty generic",,,,,,,,1612459417,,,582830,,,,,,582830,,,,,po

They key is to be confident, and assertive if necessary, around other people, and that comes from practice more than anything. If you want to look good for yourself that&#039;s great, but if you don&#039;t learn how to feel confident regardless of your looks, you&#039;ll become overly reliant on them and you&#039;ll just be a slightly better looking socially awkward guy. Or you can go for plastic surgery until you&#039;re a 10/10, but then what if you&#039;re not as tall or as muscular as the other guys? The issue with confidence must be addressed from within.

3085,579720,,,02/26/20(Wed)16:44:35,miss.anony.mous,,"Depends on the girl. As a girl who loves origami, I&#039;d say not really. It might impress the girl for a bit, but unless its super creative, it won&#039;t hold their interest for too long. Girls want more to a guy than just the cool things he can make or buy to impress the girl. Girls want a personality. Girls want the guy to show that he puts effort into building a relationship with them, whether it&#039;s a friendship or something more. If you use the origami to show her your personality, then that might work a little better. For example, you could use the origami to give her cute little notes that say something positive to make her day better. That could help you get closer to the girl. But if you fold a piece of paper into a little bird and show it to the girl expecting her to fall head-over-heels for you, then I hate to be bearer of bad news, but that&#039;s not how it works. But origami is still pretty cool, and it could possibly be the thing that catches the girls attention. An unconventional, uncommon, or not stereotypical hobby is a sign of unique interests, and that can make you seem interesting. But there is going to need to be more things about you that are interesting than the fact that you fold a square of paper into boats, flowers, or elephants, etc.. Wow her with big thoughts.

Rather, I&#039;m saying both MTG and MLP are niche interests with a number of extremely devoted fans who are clearly willing to pour quite a lot of money into their (strange to outsiders) hobby. Items appealing to these fans are certainly valuable because they can be sold at a high price, yet to someone uninvolved in the hobby, they would seem to be worthless. <br><br>If you think defacing the cards in this way is a waste, aren&#039;t you essentially in the same position as some &quot;outsider&quot; who sees all Magic cards as more or less worthless in the first place? They have been removed from the sphere of &quot;things you care about,&quot; but potentially become valuable and desirable to someone else. <br><br>Now, of course it&#039;s possible that the new niche for those defaced cards has become so small that there isn&#039;t actually anyone who is willing to buy them, although I don&#039;t think any of us knows whether that is the case or not. It&#039;s also perfectly reasonable to argue that MLP fans, especially ones who want to spend thousands of dollars on their hobby, are annoying, detestable, etc. But if you are someone who personally places a high value on paper cards from a &quot;fictional toy franchise&quot; such as MTG, you might want to be careful about throwing stones.",,,,,,,,1477593880,,,539829,,,,,,539829,,,,,po

Those infected had distorted usernames and a sickly green hue to their posts; the climax of infection was a biohazard badge on your posts. There were a number of Patient Zeros, which were seemingly chosen by being early posts on April 1. For one reason or another, this extended to all instances of April 1, even for other years. So, this thread -- which has posts from April 1 of other years -- had instances of Patient Zeros for posts that were made several years preceding the joke. People took notice and responded to these infects posts wildly in the hopes that they themselves would become infected and caused this thread to prematurely hit the bump limit. The Mods, being unsatisfied with this result, removed the posts in questions, restoring balance to /po/.",CHECK THESE,.png,521.0,300.0,125.0,71.0,1586336112927.0,1586336112,CkwZvRhYnAzULZWVLuWlQg==,185511.0,539829,,,,,,539829,,,,,po

When folding any tessellation it can help to make all your grid creases flexible from the start.

Like any project anywhere, having project files in the 1+k pixel range for each dimension is best. If you&#039;re in the tens or low hundreds, it&#039;ll take jagged, pixeley edges on curves too literally and try to cut them that way instead of doing a smooth curve. It&#039;s possible it&#039;ll look close to identical when it comes out, but it still takes way longer. Start your project at high resolutions! This is why I don&#039;t like jpg, especially for the pixel projects. Gives you way less control over what the machine does. <br><br>Also, clean up stray pixels in your transparent areas, because it&#039;ll take those literally, too, and it will take the time to make pinprick holes randomly.<br><br>Also, mats are generally 12&quot;x12&quot;, though they do come in other sizes and obviously can accommodate 8.5&quot;x11&quot; cardstock as long as in the program you arrange your items in such a way that it only cuts in your 8.5&quot;x11&quot; area. Final note for the moment, like any printer, it can&#039;t print in the whole 12&quot;x12&quot; area. The border it can&#039;t use is .25&quot;, leaving you with 11.5&quot;x11.5&quot;, which is honestly pretty good imo. <br><br><br>Here&#039;s another project from that year.

There&#039;s a tool that comes with the machine that basically functions as a reinforced credit card so you can press the paper harder against the mat. I did that HARD so it didn&#039;t move the circle out of place when just the circle was cut out but the numbers weren&#039;t yet. There&#039;s also like a metal spatula thing. Especially when the blade is getting duller, applying pressure with that metal thing right next to the blade of the machine as it&#039;s cutting to keep the paper pressed hard down can make a huge difference in whether or not the paper ends up tearing up off the mat. Also, on those mats, since it defaults to placing things at the top left, that spot gets less sticky fastest. I ended up having to move the columns of dots to the right of the mat so it was in a stickier place. Finally, if you design your project files for 8.5x11, don&#039;t line up your paper edge with the far left grid edge on the mat! Put it .25 inches to the right, since that space is dead space the cricut can&#039;t cut to. If you&#039;re using my trick with the black side and bottom lines for scaling, you&#039;ll have light (or heavy after a while) marking on the mat where it cuts that line out. Line up the edge of your 8.5x11 paper with that line to be sure the things on the far right don&#039;t end up cut off. Also, take the time to clean your mats off of little paper scraps with that metal spatula ALL THE WAY every single time. They will last MUCH longer. That&#039;s all that comes to mind.

After seeing her for some time i thought i could gift her something. My idea was to buy a chocolate, and attach the snowflake origami to it with the loopy tape thingy, and hope for her to like it. After some days of thinking what day i could give it to her i finally decided to go for it on my birthday, that day i would have enough courage to gift it to her and hopefully make her smile and afterwarsa give her a big hug. So i send her a text asking her at what time she was available, we agree to meet at her place. She was so nice and cute that i couldn&#039;t wait to see her, after going out and buying the biggest bar of chocolate i could find and taping thle origami on it i go out. After reaching her apartment i go up the elevator, my heartbeat raising and i finay get to her door. She opens it and kisses me in my cheek, after some small talk i tell her i brought something for her and she immediately jumps of joy, insisting me to show it to her. I do and she smiles and hugs me. She loved it! I was so happy, i never thought that my arms would ever hug such a beautiful and nice girl. After that she kissed me, it was a long and messy kiss, hehe.

My 4th grade teacher was into origami and had all us kids learn it. We made a couple simple models, but the one that stuck with me was the crane. I tried getting more into origami and papercraft, but I was too young and impatient to do the harder models. However, I kept folding cranes throughout my middle school years. When I was (frequently) bored in class, I would rip out a square and fold a crane. I left them everywhere, but I can&#039;t remember if anyone ever asked me about it. My crane folding habits waned in high school, but I still remember how to fold them. I&#039;m home from college now and the pandemic has re-sparked my interest in origami.<br><br>To actually answer OP&#039;s question, I&#039;ve recently been making foxes (pic rel), inspired by <a href=""#p566529"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;566529</a>.

I am also the anon who requested Kokonoe Konono by the wrong name. Pulled the name from a Google Translate of the page on S.V.&#039;s site, must have grabbed the wrong name, my bad.

It&#039;s snowing today, first snow of the season, and it&#039;s nearing christmas and I did open my 2. advent calendar door today, so I am in a good mood.

If he/she finds out that these files are really getting shared everywhere, he/she will stop making free papercrafts alltogether, so please, don&#039;t share this around freely accessible pages, because the designer will get a fit and we will never see a free papercraft again. That&#039;s the only thing really. Please, share it responsibly so we get to see many more papercraft from S.V. in the future. <br><br>P.S. If anybody has the new papercrafts where you actually have to pay to get them, like &quot;Atelier Ryza&quot; etc., please share them on the site as well? Or if anybody pitches in with me and creates an accout on the site so we can get those premium ones as well, that would be awesome. <br><br>Anyway, enjoy and keep on giving people.

In that thread you said, &quot;People in the buisness, that at least got into it +5 years know exactly what papercrafts on there are the ones that are nowhere else to be found.&quot; You also said that because of this you wouldn&#039;t &#039;spam&#039; this site with your requests. Understand I have been at this for almost 4 years, been coming here for 2, &amp; don&#039;t find much of what is on paper.tv particularly difficult to find. This is why I ask for your list of &quot;nowhere to be found&quot;, as I think it might differ from mine and others. I want to help &amp; I want you to make good on your complete offer. If I have a list of what you need, in the order of importance, I can see what I can do &amp; more efficiently... and in turn you can reciprocate in kind. This will only serve to accelerate the sharing for everyone&#039;s benefit &amp; reward those doing the sharing directly. Everyone else benefits, regardless. I have no problem posting my list in order of importance to move things.. the more encouraged those who are sharing are, the more sharing that will happen.<br><br>I&#039;m sharing regardless... I&#039;m sure there are some models that you want more. Ones that if that was all you were to walk away with you would prefer.

I did say I will share those S.V. crafts I have for a Christmas gift, else I got no idea what people want to trade or anything. Ohh, the S.V. papercrafts include crafts that were before the &quot;I sell stuff for money only&quot; thing, so I got the old deleted ones, and not the new &quot;buy me&quot; ones, that&#039;s why I asked for the paid ones if anybody has them. Particulary Ryza, yes. <br><br>On that note again, regarding the list, I got some Sabi996 or Sabi96 papercrafts that he didn&#039;t release anywhere and you got pics of those in his DA gallery. Maybe something from there interests you and we can trade.

So, if you are willing to trade some more, I can write my mail, or you write yours and we can start the actual trade. <br><br>I am eagerly awaiting what others got to offer for this trade ;) enjoy",,,,,,,,1607423320,,,586087,,,,,,586087,,,,,po

I already canceled the link, so whoever has them, don&#039;t share them online in visible groups anymore. <br><br>Second, surely S.V. doesn&#039;t give a damn about 4chan, since Japanese proxys are banned on here, I should know, I am one. So, no way the info got out for these. More likely, the widely disputed sites, such as &quot;PaperzoneVN&quot; that shares open links everywhere, including Facebook and Twitter, are sharing the files of S.V. Although I don&#039;t get what the freak out is, the ones being distributed are the free ones anyway, so no idea why Japanese designers are such pansies for these files. S.V. is actually freaking out about the free ones being distirbuted, not the premium ones. <br>This kind of mentality is also seen with other authors of 3D models and such, and they give them out for free and then complain that the links get shared on other pages. No idea what the fuss is all about. <br><br>In any case, I did my part and people should do theirs. I was one of the ones that ACTUALLY BUILD THEM, not just stacked them away in some crappy folder, so how about thinking of support like that and also actually making the papercrafts and sending pictures of them and showing your support like that. I think that is also a reason that people get so tight with their papercraft designs, because you don&#039;t see them actually being made.

BUT if the files get shared, it&#039;s always traced back to the author (be it with the name of the files and the author, the rules in it, the typical style, etc.). It actually HELPS designers to get more exposure that way, because people who like them and their work, will definetly find their sites (even if not listed in external links), and people that don&#039;t support them, won&#039;t do that even if they download the files on their own original page. So again, I don&#039;t see what the fuss is all about, it&#039;s all about exposure and how to reap the benefits of it as much as you can.

Hate wankers that actually want people to PAY for FREE papercrafts. Hate this so much. Because it happens to my designs as well. <br><br>But 1. it won&#039;t stop, even if you have a pay-wall. I guess it does catch in the damage made, since people are less likely to share if they have to get real money for it. BUT this also means that you only get a small support from people. Let&#039;s face it, the papercraft community is small as it is, and probably what, 5% to max 10% of them are actually willing to pay for a papercraft design. <br><br>2. People that actually buy papercrafts and don&#039;t look around for patterns and Google them, are total idiots. So, if you spend money on something that can actually be still obtaned online, you are the dumbass. That being said, it really doesn&#039;t have benefits for the real author, just a bad taste that somebody is making money/fame/reputation the designer should get.<br><br>It is a complicated issue, I understand this. And there is no 1 solution, and things the way are going right now, even less people will want to buy anything really. The community is small as it is, and people are shying away from crafts because most are too stupid to put together a more complicated thing (no motor skills, passivness, lazyness, etc.), so pay-wall hidden content doesn&#039;t really solve the issue for papercrafts in the long run. Don&#039;t know, in any case, I think we are through with S.V. and his/her free crafts in any case. As for the other designers that actually are staying and making a difference, I think it should be our duty to at least try to support them, show some respect, build the things that people are actually hoarding, and comment on things. You would not believe the difference 1 nice comment can make when a designer makes something new.

The pic is the better version and the actual model you get is the lesser version. If you are doing a trade, this can piss off some people. It makes a big difference sometimes.

A lot of the greats and even people on this board utilize mc to shape their models even though mc is a glue. Satoshi Kamiya&#039;s Ryujin has a wire armature inside to help it keep its shape. Even the most elementary origami book will probably have the dog/cat face model with drawn eyes. Sorry to burst your bubble, but all the greats &quot;cheat&quot; in origami in some form or another.

The fundamental accuracy (or lack) of a clock comes down to two or three main things: the escapement (the escape wheel + pallets), the pendulum, and what powers the escapement.<br><br>The escapement is the most critical piece; you have losses due to friction, to how the pallets and the wheel interact, recoil, etc. (See the fine wikipedia article for more detail.) With paper, you have less thermal expansion to worry about, but humidity levels can cause even bigger shifts in size.<br><br>For more technical details, I recommend the books &quot;The Quest for Longitude&quot; (Andrewes, ed; Harvard) or &quot;Watchmaking&quot; (George Daniels).",,,,,,,,1475702570,,,539494,,,,,,539494,,,,,po

From your pictures I don&#039;t think you have made the gears to a fine enough tolerance, are you flooding them with glue too? If a couple of teeth are wonky the mechanism will jam (as I found out) and you will need to use more weight to get it to turn causing the structure to bend.<br><br>I have also made the gear heart and this suffers from the same problem you need at most a 1.5mm tolerance on most pieces otherwise it will jam and bend.<br><br>Good luck friend.",,,,,,,,1478895950,,,539494,,,,,,539494,,,,,po

And if this thread dies, all those haters will get exactly what they want. i believe origami should have an open source platform, where we can all share knowledge, models, maths, so we can actually get more people into origami. I understand that these origami pro’s want all their hard work to pay off, but unfortunately our community isn’t currently big enough for these pro’s to get rich from it. As always in life, money is the root to all evil. And in this case, it’s causing the art of origami to grow slow, if any at all. <br><br>I don’t really get the current state of 4chan thread too much.

They have no reason to complain or bitch about t. Rule of thumb is just fucking scroll on if you have something or whatever. Sometimes you can get what you already have in better quality.
