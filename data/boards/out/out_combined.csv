More or less, it&#039;s asking if anyone is opposed to the couple&#039;s marriage. &quot;In tradition, this would be the time to speak your mind if you disagreed with the relationship, but &#039;holding your peace&#039; would mean that you&#039;re choosing to accept the couple&#039;s future together,&quot; she explains. <br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Why is &#039;Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace&#039; Said at Weddings?</span><br><br>Wilson puts it best when she says humans are creatures of habit, and we thrive with tradition. Since historically, weddings have taken place in religious institutions, most couples follow what rules set forth from previous generations. In fact, Wilson says up until recently, most couples chose to honor their parents and grandparents by holding their wedding ceremony at a church. With input from a best friend, an uncle, an expert, and even the internet, most duos decide to do what&#039;s best for them instead. This makes the phrase less prominent. Also, when the congregation is encouraged to &#039;speak now or forever hold their peace&#039; — it&#039;s not taken literally, according to wedding expert Kevin Dennis.",VWCaddy,.jpg,1012.0,678.0,125.0,83.0,1612929195021.0,1612929195,bmhGgGLKGiJunkRsnkuQYw==,119894.0,2007319,,,,,,2007319,,,,,out

If you&#039;re both new, maybe start with some cheap spincasters (a Bass Pro or whatever should have cheap rod/reel combos available). If it turns out you love fishing, look into getting and learning how to use spinning reels later, as he gets older, as they provide much more control over how you cast, which is really important for fishing with lures.<br><br>For your first experience, if you&#039;re looking for the most action (and with an 8yo, you probably are), actually get 3 or 4 rod/reels. Use two for fishing with small lures (cast them out, slowly reel back in, cast again... until a fish bites) and use the other(s) for setting worms/minnows and bobbers at the same time.<br><br>You&#039;re probably going to want to watch some YT videos to learn how to effectively fish with lures vs bobber, etc.",,,,,,,,1612682050,,,1998623,,,,,,1998623,,,,,out

If you need boots, buy some and wear them around town for a few days to break them in. Pack a snack and a lot of water (24oz or more). Check the weather to see how warm you need to dress, or if you&#039;ll need rain gear, or if you&#039;ll need sunscreen.

If you&#039;re hiking and you come across s stream that&#039;s a couple inches deep and you need to cross, you can. If you have to wade across anything, expect wet feet. Take your boots off and hang them on your pack or around your neck at that point.",,,,,,,,1612959384,,,1998623,,,,,,1998623,,,,,out

An American generally has basically no barrier to obtaining a firearm and carrying relative to many other countries. Most folks that carry in the woods aren&#039;t getting a license and purchasing a gun for the possibility of an animal attack. They are taking a gun which they already own and carry into the woods with them because they don&#039;t see any less of reason to do so than strapping up to go anywhere else. And if they go enough into the woods than obtaining a firearms which is more optimal in size and cartridge is again, essentially no harder than hitting up the local store. I don&#039;t carry bear mace myself because it&#039;s rare to have an animal encounter and I&#039;m significantly more proficient with a gun I&#039;ve carried for years over a can bear mace which I&#039;ve never used, let alone bought and practiced with enough obtaining from wherever it lives on me.<br><br>Tldr, Americans have guns and we take them when we go places.",,,,,,,,1612647651,,,2004557,,,,,,2004557,,,,,out

In this case, I don&#039;t feel like ill be attacked by a mountain lion or bear, but since I can bring a pistol easily, since i do all the time and I&#039;m familiar with it, its not much of leap to bring it versus leaving it.",,,,,,,,1612661783,,,2004557,,,,,,2004557,,,,,out

The only gun they had was Bella&#039;s single-shot bolt-action .22 Rimfire rifle. They were walking a cutline that had been made for oil exploration when they saw a large grizzly following the same survey line toward them. If they ran, the bear would probably notice them and might chase, so they quietly sat down on a brush pile and hoped that the bear would pass by without trouble. But the bear<br>came much too close, and when the big boar was only a few yards away, Bella Twin shot him in the side of the head with a .22 Long cartridge. The bear dropped, kicked and then lay still. Taking no chances, Bella went up close and fired all of the cartridges she had, seven or eight .22 Longs, into the bear&#039;s head. That bear, killed in 1953, was the world-record grizzly for several years and is still high in the records today.&quot;<br><br>inb4 long gun not a hand gun.",Bella Twin,.jpg,351.0,450.0,97.0,125.0,1612744275595.0,1612744275,lit3hdila6KqjzTFoZ/bWg==,21597.0,2004557,,,,,,2004557,,,,,out

They&#039;re too heavy and are generally uncomfortable compared to civilian boots. They&#039;re also completely useless for mountaineering. Neither would you wear mountaineering boots when hiking. They&#039;re also too heavy, though less so, and have way too stiff of a sole for long walks through flat terrain. When hiking you either wear trail runners, hiking shoes or lightweight, mid-cut hiking boots. All this rambling about how rugged and/or cheap combat boots are or that you need their ankle support is just coping poorfags and seething Dunning-Krugeroids. Trust me, I&#039;ve owned combat boots before and tried hiking in them. The thing you posted is so far removed from the pieces of shit OP posted it&#039;s not even funny. They&#039;re more like a regular Salomon hiking boot with an extra-high shaft than any kind of combat boot posted ITT. They might even be fine for hiking in.

Incredible trails and a fairly large area all together. If you park at Glen Helen it has good access to the towns but a $5 fee. Don&#039;t park at any of the Clifton entrances or your car will be broken into.<br><br>Germantown Metropark and Twin Creek Metropark over by Kettering is really pleasant with some terrain that doesn&#039;t even really feel like Ohio in some spots. There&#039;s a connector trail between the two of them that connects them all together called the Twin Valley Trail that&#039;s a total of 22 miles. It&#039;s got a lot of steepness for Ohio, a lot of it situated on an Indian fort.<br><br>Caeser Creek Statepark is nice for fucking off in a random direction. There&#039;s a big loop at the bottom around the lake that&#039;s flanked by some pretty big unmarked sections that are reserved for hunters, but you can just slip in and disappear in the off-season.<br><br>Wayne NF is a blast. National Forests have much more relaxed rules than parks, so if you&#039;re into bushcrafty shit, it&#039;s a good time. Just make sure to take your shit down when you&#039;re done.<br><br>Zaleski SF is similarly lax. Really good destination for backpacking, cheap and good backcountry sites and a lot of trails. Also has a couple of historical sites if you&#039;re into that, there&#039;s an old iron forge and a few pieces of related abandoned infrastructure in the area.<br><br>If you&#039;re looking for a drive, Red River Gorge remains the top of my recommendations.

If you&#039;re in the lower midwest, for instance, you get to enjoy nasty ice and cold temps, but no lasting snow. This means your only real winter option is hiking, which is just a shittier version of the same activity in the other four seasons, plus retardedly short, overcast days to make it even worse.<br><br>I&#039;m guessing most of us who hate winter live in a region like this.

I just really enjoyed camping with the other guys. We were a really tight knit group, 6-7 of us total (of those 15 and older). Keep in mind we did all car camping. On winter campouts, we&#039;d set up two tents: a smaller one for our backpacks and a big one that we&#039;d all sleep in together. The tent would get so warm from our body heat that we&#039;d sleep in our base layers. <br>At one of the places we went, there was a huge pond that froze over in the winter, so we cleared out a strip of snow on it, got a few big container lids, and used them to slide across the ice. <br>Summer camp was a week long every year, and it included a few merit badge classes every day. We&#039;d all sign up for the same badges so we could hang out all day. Then we&#039;d head down to the shower house and dick around there and on the way. <br>When there was downtime at camp, especially when we were the only ones at that particular park or reservation, we&#039;d all go &quot;exploring,&quot; as in, hiking without any direction, just to find the weird plants or structures around the park. <br>I really miss those times.",,,,,,,,1612563352,,,2003639,,,,,,2003639,,,,,out

Though if someone refused to do the PT, badges, or outings they would be kicked out of the troop. I was talking to a friend I had in college who was a scout in a different area about it.

However, if you want to try some of the hallucinogenic amanitas, I&#039;ll give you a few pointers, just to lessen the potential damage, as these can be very unpredictable.<br><br>First of all, gather a bunch of them, preferably A. muscaria, as like you said, they are a bit weaker than the pantherinas. What you&#039;re going to do, is to familiarize yourself with the effects. Basically, start with microscopic doses and work your way up over a few weeks or months until you get the effects you&#039;re looking for.<br><br>With larger doses, it&#039;s generally safer to split the dose into smaller doses that you take over the course of an evening.<br><br>Whatever you do, make sure you cure them properly. Drying them the right way is crucial in order to make them less toxic. Also don&#039;t consume any carbonated drinks once you&#039;ve ingested the fungi. Although they are considered toxic, they&#039;re not very potently so. At least not when compared to other members of the Amanita genus. So long as you pace yourself, and don&#039;t scarf down 2lbs of the fucking things like a retard, you&#039;ll be fine.<br><br>I&#039;ve never really gotten any hallucinations from them except one very brief second when the wall wobbled kind of like the paintings in Super Mario 64. The effects I get from them are mainly physical, and they don&#039;t really feel like anything else. I guess the best way I can explain it is that it&#039;s a mix between a mild ethanol buzz and a cannabis high. It&#039;s honestly great for when you just want to watch movies and play games.",,,,,,,,1612611037,,,2004413,,,,,,2004413,,,,,out

One last thing, I&#039;ll just go over the basic chemistry behind it, as it is kind of important.<br>These amanitas contain two main compounds, ibotenic acid and muscimol. They&#039;re both hallucinogenic, but the ibotenic acid is more... sickening, I guess you could say, than the muscimol.<br>What happens when you dry the fungi, is that you basically remove one carboxyl group from the ibotenic acid molecule, and turns it into carbon dioxide and muscimol. In other words, it becomes a bit more potent and less toxic at the same time. It&#039;s also why you shouldn&#039;t drink carbonated beverages with it, as the carbon dioxide present in those will bind with the muscimol and turn it back into ibotenic acid, which will mainly make you vomit and sweat like a pig.

First time ever finding morels as they are super rare here so i decided to risk the dog shit, cleaned them well and dried. Amazing taste/texture, definitely on my top 3. Made some ramen and calzone from these.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Porcini/Cep, Boletus edulis</span><br>Best year for these by far, i must have picked around 15-20 lbs. Dried these as well since im not so fond of the texture when cooked fresh. They give great flavour tho especially in soups and stews.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Matsutake, Tricholoma matsutake</span><br>This was an interesting one. I was hiking with my father and i happened upon these beautiful specimens which i immediately recognized as matsutake. This would be grade A in Japan, small, firm caps that have yet to open. Sadly since we were out in the middle of nowhere with no internet we couldn&#039;t risk a potential missidentification. Later at home i did some research and boy do i regret not biting the bullet and trying these. Turns out there are a couple closely related species in the genus Tricholoma that are sold as &quot;Matsutake&quot; but Finland is the only place where you can find the exact same species as in Japan which is the mushroom pictured here. A lot of &quot;matsutake&quot; is imported to Japan from mainland asia but that is actually a different species. I hope to find these again<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Funnel Chantarelle, Craterellus tubaeformis</span><br>These have been my bread and butter ever since i started foraging as a kid, great yield, flavor and ease of use. This year i only picked 8-10 lbs or so, i often freeze these but now i dried them. I like to keep these whole and use in sauces or fried in a pan.<br><br>Apart from these i also found some Lactifluus volemus (a type of milk-cap[?]) which is also pretty rare and delicious. Some say it tastes faintly like lobster or crayfish, with some dill and cream added i can almost say the same.

Don’t hitchhike at night. Have your witts about you. Plus in some states the worst punishment you’ll get for hitchhiking would likely be a slap in the wrist and the police telling you to fuck off.

Smaller the tent the better, especially for heat. Bulky, can be hard to carry effectively and troublesome to camouflage. Need clear level ground to deploy.<br><br>Hammock: easy to carry, comfortable, versatile. the go-to to for sleeping anywhere. Trivial to camouflage. Takes a certain degree of skill to use effectively, troublesome to shield from the elements. Use tarp and p-cord to provide cover from rain. Need two anchor points close to each other to deploy.<br><br>Keep your camp hidden and move often. If you need to build a fire, place campfire beneath a big tree or build a dakota fire hole.<br><br>Buy region specific colored tarp, p-cord, knife, machete, garden shovel, backpack, few metal clothes hangers or metal stakes, lighters, zipties, plastic bags, multivitamins, baby wipes, pen and paper, duct tape, hygiene supplies and a five gallon bucket. Off ya go then.<br><br>Transportation: Highly recommended to give a vehicle. Vehicles arent cheap to maintain but the benefits far outweigh the costs, main one being storage and emergency shelter. Otherwise invest in a bicycle you can ride.<br><br>Food: choices are to live near town with soup kitchens at least a day a week and ample opportunities for work and dumpster diving, or live out in the wilderness with the skills necessary to live off the land.

If you cant play an instrument to save your life, buy a harmonica. Selling items can land you in hot water without permits. <br>Find a church and go at least once a month, even if you arent religious. You need a community outside of your homeless community. <br><br>Safety &amp; Defense: Always have a smartphone on you with at least 50% charge. Even if you have no intention of buying service, you can still dial 911 and absolutely should take advantage if your in a dire situation.<br>On your journey it is inevitable you will run into law enforcement.

For two months I was at a loss, and it culminated in my quitting my job and hoofing around while I was young. I was 22 when I set out from small town to small town with a 50lbs pack on, walking rail tracks and roads and camping innawoods along the way. It was lonely, at times scary, people were curious but not impressed when they asked me what I was doing which hurt. I wanted to be interesting, but this is now how it was perceived. The loneliness was the worst part. It was horrible. I went further into a depression and it was very hard to pull myself out. The loss a working year made it so ai had to start at the bottom at a new job unrelated to my education because I had several interviews that left me feeling embarrassed when they brought up my hiatus. None liked the sound of hiring a hobo, I could tell. I never recovered to the point at which I&#039;d be now if I didn&#039;t do it, and I gained nothing from it. The only way I&#039;d recommend it is if you know you don&#039;t want to go back to an average life afterwards but would instead like to be a hobo forever or kill yourself when you&#039;re done walking. The hobos I met were always creeps abd disgusting. There is no glamor nor glory, and I truly believe no benefits at all from pursuing this to advance your self or state of mind.

Even someone very affluent in converted Mercedes sprinter has social disorders if they would rather be isolated. You may think that&#039;s all well and good but most men dont break down and really care about their family till their grandkids are born and then they break down and get all emotional and shit. This is the way. Your father carrys you. When it&#039;s your turn, you carry your father. Anons itt, do not be a bum. Traveling is one thing. If you have no other option though, you should be seeking other options, not trying to figure out homelessness. Because in reality there&#039;s always another option. Even the most hardcore fur trapping bastard of history was in fact only out there to aquire wealth. We think of the outdoorsmen of steel age history like savages but the ones actually exploring were generally very well to do, or gaining a fortune by their endeavors. You could be making a fortune doing what you&#039;re already doing. Become a glass eel hunter or something. Money isnt evil. The love of money is. I dont love it I&#039;m just sane enough to understand I need it in order to have a future. This is not a new concept. The present regime has not come up with some scam. Money has existed for a long time. Jesus christ himself said if a man will not work do not let him eat, because when he gets hungry enough, he will work.

When I was young I watched some documentary about these people living in the bush and Alaska and had that dream forever. In middle school I started wrestling and that took up my entire life for the next 12 years. After I got out of college I didn&#039;t have wrestling anymore and started training at an MMA gym where I met a Russian guy from Yekaterinburg who showed me &quot;Happy people a year in the taiga&quot; and would continuously share stories with me about growing up in Russia and that dream came rushing back to me except with Russia and has haunted me ever since. Problem is I am now 25, in constant pain from old injuries, have a good job, am getting really good at bjj, and I&#039;m genuinely enjoying life. Im afraid to throw it all away to fly halfway around the world with nothing to chase the dream of a child. But I think of it literally every day, I&#039;ve bought books to try and learn Russian, I spend pretty much all my free time reading and watching videos on homesteading and life in Russia, it&#039;s an obsession. I know I will have to go and try, I&#039;m stuck with memories from wrestling where I can&#039;t stop wondering what would happen if I pushed just a little harder and they keep me up at night and I don&#039;t want this to be the same way, but I&#039;m terrified of taking that leap. I&#039;ve been saving for it since I graduated and now have enough to do it 3 or 4 times over, I just can&#039;t pull the trigger. I never thought myself a coward but this fills me with pure anxious terror any time I start working towards anything concrete, I haven&#039;t even applied for a passport yet.",,,,,,,,1611456301,,,1980736,,,,,,1980736,,,,,out

I&#039;m in physically capable, I&#039;m financially capable, and I&#039;m intellectually capable. But yet I have sat still for two whole years now absolutely terrified of this dream. I&#039;m not afraid of failure, my whole life has been boom or bust and there is no shame in giving something everything you have just to fall short. I&#039;m afraid of getting on a plane and leaving everyone and everything I&#039;ve ever known or loved behind. In a very weird way I&#039;m worried that I will succeed and that I will never be able to come to things as they are now, that while I&#039;m off chasing this dream the rest of my life will leave me behind. I think that&#039;s what scares me the most. Knowing that all I have to do is go, but not knowing what will happen when I&#039;m gone. I don&#039;t suppose it means anything to you unless you wrestled, but it&#039;s the same feeling as you last match. You know what to do, you know how to do it, but every match before you knew that win or lose your going to be back on the mats practicing with your coaches the next day. With the last match there is nothing. You win your done, you lose your done. There is no guarantee what you will be doing tomorrow.

As far as returning to society goes, that&#039;s a definite risk, but you are young enough to pull off the &#039;I wanted to travel Europe before settling into a career&#039; excuse. My biggest concern for you is that you mentioned that your mental health is &#039;pure shite&#039;; if you mean that you&#039;re disenchanted with society and progress and feel more comfortable with living life at your own pace, then you&#039;re probably in the same position as myself, where you&#039;d find you need that freedom. If you mean that you have a clinical mental problem, I&#039;d recommend seeking help to work through those issues and maybe get something to level you out, because if you have those types of difficulties, they won&#039;t just magically go away if you run from them. You have to be pretty introspective and self-critical here, because if you do it for the wrong reasons, it won&#039;t go well. If you can normally handle weeks in the wilderness, you&#039;re probably better equipped than most, but again, be critical, it&#039;s not an easy life. Also, I&#039;m not familiar with UK law, so you need to do your own research regarding what kinds of difficulties you&#039;d face in that regard; in the US, there&#039;s pretty much just a 16 day limit before I have to move again, which I find to be about the right amount of time to stay in one place anyway.",,,,,,,,1611511552,,,1980736,,,,,,1980736,,,,,out

As long as you look clean and don&#039;t come off as a deranged crack addict (aka you look homeless), you will have a good time. Look up volunteering for hostels. Very easy way to get poon too. I had gf&#039;s everytime I was doing it, but if I was single back then I could have fucked a lot. You can also volunteer on farms with helpx, etc. Just get a good deal that is no more than 20 hours of easy work per week for accomodation and food. Best volunteering experience I had was in Dublin where I did less than 16 hours weekly, mostly buying milk or cleaning out empty parts of building on my own and in my own pace. On farmsteads, etc. the accomodation is most often private room or even a seperate house, but in hostels it&#039;s typically shared. Benefit with hostels is that they&#039;re in relevant cities and it is easy to stay at a hostel, work part time there and do something like waiting tables somewhere else part time for cash-in hand to save up. Ignore all the tards saying you shouldn&#039;t do this because you&#039;ll somehow magically wind up being a homeless bum. Be a drifter, not a random bum. Look into getting a good backpack.

Having a bed to sleep, washing facilities for clothes and a place to meet people can be useful. Hostels are generally inexpensive. I&#039;m not saying you should stay there full time, because at that point renting a room or a flat is cheaper and better, but anyone who has ever travelled for more than day without their mum understand that they are very useful facilities.

A rain jacket is pretty universal, but in the Gulf South it’s just too warm for any kind of jacket most of the year. The type of rain we get in late spring through the summer is usually caused from moist air from the Gulf of Mexico creating sporadic, scattered showers with little or no wind, followed by periods of sunshine. Typical tropical/subtropical patterns. A jacket or poncho is absolute hell in those conditions. <br><br>In more temperate areas and deserts the shade is a no-brainer.

Most nordic centers that groom will have a wide lane of groomers with a lane for skate, the channels for classic/nordic and then usually some room left over for other use. <br><br>Most classic/nordic skis are the very skinny kind you usually see at nordic centers, these struggle anywhere but on groomed trails. I have two pairs of XC skis, one is a rossignol OT 65 and the other is the rossignol BC 80. The offtrack 65 has fish scales underfoot (as opposed to waxing your skis with grippy wax) and is skinny enough to fit into classic tracks but is a little wider to handle a couple inches of powder. My BC 80&#039;s are way too wide for nordic centers but have more float for powder and also a full metal edge, so they&#039;re a lot better in the backcountry. The wider ski also doesn&#039;t track as straight nor is as fast as a super skinny XC ski so there&#039;s trade offs. A lot of the fun of nordic skiing is zooming around and logging a lot of miles and if you live near to a nordic center or somewhere with lots of ski use (ie a ski track will be laid down in the snow) this could be a fun option. If you want a bit of both I&#039;d recommend something like the Rossi OT 65 Evo, has a partial metal edge, can still use at nordic and is pretty quick too. That being said I use my BC 80&#039;s more because they&#039;re more versatile, I took them out for ~15 mile BC tour in RMNP yesterday.<br><br>I don&#039;t mind answering any other questions you have, its all a bit confusing at first. Also depends largely on what you want to do, but try not to balk at the price tag and kind accept that having a quiver of skis/boots is a good thing, down the line.",,,,,,,,1611503632,,,1985185,,,,,,1985185,,,,,out

I want to try a little bit of everything including skating, so versatile is perfect while I explore local spots and see what I like most. to be honest I&#039;m not too familiar with the Nordic centers around me or if there are any, and since all piste centers around me are closed for the coof I&#039;m not sure if the nordic centers would even be operating.

BUT DONT BUY THIS SEASONS SKIS. Any big ski shop will have pairs of brand new skis in plastic that were made last season or the season before, buy these save several hundred. If you&#039;re really new, there&#039;s 3 main characteristics to worry about. <br>Length, shorter means tighter turns more manuverable, longer means better at handling rough terrain. Generic is right around your height<br>Width, mostly for surface area of your ski, bigger skis mean you float more in powder, but make it much harder to get up on edge quickly and hold it in icy conditions, as the edge is no longer located under your footprint.<br>Camber, effects the same things as width (floating and edging) but in a different way, read an article about it.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Bindings</span><br>Someone out there will tell me I&#039;m stupid but I&#039;ve skied for ~20 years and have never had bindings change the way I ski. Find the cheapest pair you can at a thrift store that don&#039;t look like total shit and have DIN&#039;s high enough for you level of skiing, might have to buy them attached to an old shitty pair of skis (viola, you also have rock skis for early season) and have them mounted to your shiny new skis when you buy them.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;boots</span><br>Spend some money and time cause these will make or break a day, trip, season. Go find a big ski store very close to a mountain and see if you can demo multiple boots in a day. Spend an hour or 2 in them on the slopes, less if they feel like shit, then swap them out for a better pair. The guys in the shop will know what they are doing. At a place like big 5, REI, cabelas, ect. where skiing is just a part of the store it can be really hit or miss if the guys are top notch or not so i generally steer away from those places. buy the boots you like or try to find them cheaper online",,,,,,,,1611779462,,,1985185,,,,,,1985185,,,,,out

Slow down all lifts so they can be disinfected between uses. No more than five or ten skiers at a time. Ban all snowboarding until further notice because they have higher injury rates and they are diverting emergency resources away from minority only slopes.

I bring an inclinometer when going to a new spot to make sure that I’m staying in safe terrain. Taking aaire 1 will help you to better understand avalanches and how to travel in the backcountry if you haven’t already don the course. I would also recommend reading Staying Alive in Avalanche Terrain whether you have taken the course or not.

That little lake is in a position where it only gets sunlight in the morning and evening, so it will be much colder throughout the day than nearby areas.

A pair of comfortable shoes will suffice, but DO get straps for your pedals. Makes a huge difference in how much energy you use while cycling. <br>-Bring a small cleaning kit and give your gears/chain a light cleaning at least twice a week. You&#039;re putting a lot of miles on a bike compared to any riding you do for fun in the city.<br>-Get a high-quality pair of tires for the bike if it doesn&#039;t already have one. For comparison, the stock tires on my bike lasted 900 miles before practically disintegrating whereas a new pair from Giant were hardly worn when I finished 1100 miles later. Needing a new innertube on the road is no big deal. Needing a new tire can be a trip-ender. One of the stock tires broke while I was in small-town Missouri, and the closest shop that carried 700c tires was 94 miles away, and I had to spend an entire day looking for a ride. If I hadn&#039;t met a nice church pastor, I might have had to do dark shit to get a ride.<br>-Get a small bike computer, even a cheap one from Walmart. The odometer is extremely useful for navigation, and the speedometer really helps you find your most efficient gearing, as well as also aiding in navigation.<br>-Other than that it&#039;s not much different from a hiking trip, and the gear you bring is almost identical.",,,,,,,,1611533588,,,1987180,,,,,,1987180,,,,,out

It was dirt trail until Cumberland, MD, but after that it was fucking muddy and boggy wetlands for like 80 miles. I&#039;m talking like 3-6inches of soaking mud and water. Every &quot;dry&quot; section was a godsend. It was hilarious though, because I kept passing all these guys riding $1000+ off-road bikes with specialty handlebars and super-wide tires, while I&#039;m flying through on a $130 Schwinn with hybrid road tires and 40lbs of gear over my rear tire. I had to learn to let the bike drift and slide through mud and just gently guide it, but I never fell over or had to put my foot down once. The only problem I encountered was that my pedal crankset rusted and broke, which basically rendered my bike unusable. But by sheer luck, it broke not even 100 yards from a bike shop located just off-trail as it passed through a small town, and I got it replaced for like $40. Also before going on the trail I had to fashion a set of mudguards from carboard, duct tape, and zip ties, so I would recommend getting real ones instead.",,,,,,,,1611602202,,,1987180,,,,,,1987180,,,,,out

Regarding tubeless tires, I think your opinion on them might come from the fact that you were riding on roads. Tubeless are more common in the MTB/offroad world where they do save weight compared to using tubes. Also allow to lower tyre pressure to get more grip, and they can prevent flats. None of that matters if you&#039;re riding on roads I guess.<br><br>Speaking of which, how the hell did you manage riding on american roads for so long? Even in Europe I would get pretty nervous so I imagine that could become a nightmare in the US. How was the traffic? Got any crazy stories?<br>Btw, how was your bag setup?

Faggots on their 5000 euro bikes can go and neck themselves, they act like they are hot shit but I can easily do more distance in a week on my shitheel bike than they can on their luxury racer.",,,,,,,,1612362159,,,1987180,,,,,,1987180,,,,,out

That being said, those military style mess kits are a bit cumbersome for a solo outfag, not really good for cooking or eating out of, can live with it, but you are doing yourself no favors there. If you are looking for something versatile and with a reasonable price tags you may look for something like in the pic, it&#039;s a standard scout mess kit here, made in stainless steel but thin enough not to weight a ton and brand new is ~$30.

Irvine was the one who was carrying the camera so it would lie with his body. There is some evidence his body is in a certain location on a steep ledge but the snow levels are only low enough in roughly 1 of 10 years to expose the body. There was some circumstantial evidence that they made it on the corpse of George Mallory. He had famously brought a photo of his wife that he planned to bury on the summit, which was not found among his letters and other documents he had stored in a pouch in his clothing.

Staying and breathing underwater for longer periods of time exposes you to a completely different world and experience. You should at least try this once in your lifetime. Also, there&#039;s no talking underwater (except occasional hand signals), so you won&#039;t have to deal with nagging from other people except for a short period on the surface.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Is it expensive?</span><br>Any hobby has its expenses. If you choose to own your own gear instead of renting it you&#039;ll quickly drive up quite a hefty cost. However, if you turn out to be an active diver the initial investment is usually worth it over time.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Isn&#039;t SCUBA diving dangerous?</span><br>Yes, you could die with very little effort (hold your breath and ascend: boom, you&#039;re dead). You should keep this in mind every time you dive. The risk is worth it though, and quite low when it comes to recreational diving between or shallower than 18-20 meters.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Can I dive alone?</span><br>Only if you accept x2 the risk of dying.",,,,,,,,1603488847,,,1914691,,,,,,1914691,,,!!9LJfNud3i9k,,out

Before even getting certified though practice only breathing through your mouth.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Why learn breathing only through your mouth?</span><br>Besides likely getting water in your mask while diving at some point, there&#039;s mask flooding and mask off exercises in the course. You don&#039;t want to bolt to the surface in a panic because you suddenly snorted some water. To practice this skill, try snorkeling with swimming goggles (which won&#039;t cover your nose).<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Where to dive?</span><br>The guide is sparse for now, but if you can&#039;t find anything there then ask ITT.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Best way to log dives?</span><br>Subsurface is free as in freedom software for logging and planning dives, and it&#039;s quite possibly the best software out there.

Had to leave because my ears couldn&#039;t handle the workload anymore and I was spent mentally and physically. If anyone is thinking about this as a profession I highly recommend it.

But, depending where you find yourself working, during what times of the year, and what position you are in theres always the potential to make more. For example this summer, even with covid and the death blow it had for international tourism my friends working in Eilat made Bank, one guy earned about 16k during August(always the busiest month of the year). Mind you this was with no days off, no breaks, first dive at 8 in the morning last dive at 18-19. Its taxxing as fuck and the nitrogen in your system makes you tired as hell. Take into consideration that this is a place where you only shore dive so you have a much fuller work day since your not sailing out and doing only 4 dives the whole day like in most island resorts. The island resort path is not a bad one but from what I&#039;ve heard you eat shit in the beginning there and kind of work for your training and internship and this can drag on for a while. Skill wise I would say I was really good, technical skills(proper controlled buoyancy, underwater navigation and orientation, planning the dive etc&#039;) become second nature since you dive so much(i think I finished with above 4k dives if I&#039;m being conservative) but the real is dealing with people, learning how to teach them, control and lead a group underwater while navigating and remembering to do all the exercises in the proper order with each diver and getting them to do it well as well as remembering your on a schedule and have other dives to get to. Giving lessons in a classroom is also something you learn, how to keep people interested and pass along the information easily and uncomplicated. Regarding working on an island i know from a friend that worked in the Maldives that the dream is to find a resort and become either part of a very small team that works there or be The Guy that does diving courses exclusively",,,,,,,,1605656302,,,1914691,,,,,,1914691,,,,,out

Most times my boss would push me to sign off on these people. It a strange thing because on the one hand some of those people I know will never come back to diving and are just doing it for doing it, some people I know for sure will never dive without hiring an instructor to guide so at least they&#039;ll always have some sort of overwatch,for example a 61 year old gal in a private OW course that was the single most hardest and frustrating student i ever had. But she reached a level where she could swim level and straight(which was a huge win) could control her buoyancy okish and didn&#039;t spit her regulator out everytime we practiced mask emptying. I know she&#039;ll never go diving on her own since I drilled that into her head that she should always take an instructor as well as to her husband that she&#039;s a bit of a danger. Her saving grace was that she was very sweet and totally committed to the student role, and man at that age doing the course ain&#039;t easy and didn&#039;t give up.

Regarding Thailand, I would recommend you look up yourself what your options are. Koh Tao specifically is the place to be if you just want bulk work since its jam packed with tourists, you can get plenty of experience and make a humble pay that covers the basics(housing, food, booze, weed). The thing there is that there&#039;s a crazy amount of dive shops there and they all have the option of you coming, doing all your advanced courses to become eligible to work(rescue, divemaster, assistant instructor, instructor) over time, be it a month or several. Thing is in the beginning you work for free. Remember everything costs money, every cert is a blow to your bank account because PADI loves overcharging you, so don&#039;t get there without nothing in the hold. I would recommend you just look up which dive shops give you the option to that &quot;path&quot; of starting your way to work there for what price and how much time it would take to reach instructor and just blast off an email just to get an idea and some details. You&#039;ve got every variety there, from giant conglomerates that have a crazy turnover of courses a week(Bans) to smaller, more personal places. If you have another language besides English thats a big plus, some clubs are clientele specific(Taco Divers for Spanish speaking, some German dive shop as well).",,,,,,,,1605677762,,,1914691,,,,,,1914691,,,,,out

Most places just want to take people that work under the same organization and can bring good things to the table as in: good people skills, good work ethic, responsibility to the job, professionalism yadda yadda...<br>If you&#039;ve got the opportunity to work in a place like Hawaii though then fucking go for it man, even California if that place won&#039;t burn down in the coming months. You&#039;ve got a slew of countries in South America with diving in them that gave the same paths of starting out as a divemaster and gaining experience till the place decides they like you and want to keep you or on the other go independent and bring your own students and just rent the equipment(this would far into your career though). If your already in that part of the world I would seriously consider that, if only to take some time off, go do some courses and feel out the lifestyle to if it fits instead of flying to the other side of the planet. Take into account that jumping straight into leading courses is not the only option, I was an assistant instructor for 2 seasons before I did my instructor cert. I did introduction dives(taking someone with no certs for a 25-45 min dive while controlling their everything) guided dives(leading a group of certified divers to a site) or refresh dives(go over the basics of the theoretical material and do a check dive before they&#039;re allowed legally to dive without an instructor). I made great money and didn&#039;t have that heavy responsibility of leading groups, plus I got a lot from it people skills wise since every dive its a new person that you need to make comfortable in a situation that might be stressful for them",,,,,,,,1605681802,,,1914691,,,,,,1914691,,,,,out

Quite the opposite really, some the worst divers I&#039;ve ever seen came from there and some of the most close minded, by the book PADI cucks worked there, with eurofags complaining about muh workload omg 3-4 dives im dyinggg. Jesus christ the horrors, destruction and sheer fucking hubris that I&#039;ve seen...groups of Chinese divers of 10 clumped up like a big ball of destruction with empty BCDs basically walking on the seabed/reef sticking their cameras in every nook and cranny to snap a photo of some poor clownfish. No, the reason I WOULD recommend it though is because its cheap, accessible, has plenty of options and is generally a fun island to spend some time on, plus its like the PADI headquarters of southeast Asia so its not too difficultto pass(PADI loves moneyyy). The instructor course barley has any impact in your skill as an instructor, it gives you the cert and a rudimentary idea of what it would be like to lead a group and what kinda hoops your gonna have to jump through to certify people. You will unfortunately fuck up, flub your words or not notice someone struggling or veering off from the group or just doing the exercises poorly. Experience is the greatest teacher, finding your rhythm, and nailing down your best way of translating by speech and movement to your students how to dive.

After that one my ears were just completely fucked, they had taken such a harsh beating over my years as a dive instructor that I decided for the sake of my hearing and continues pain and repeating sinus infections and all that kinda shit I just had to leave the job.

We would free-dive down to 50ft with enough bottom time to get an ab. Most ab divers have a mental block going deeper than 35ft. Most newbs won&#039;t do past 25ft. The big abs are beyond 40ft.<br>After our limit, we would pack up the abs in the car, get the SCUBA gear out and see what we missed while scanning for the next weekend&#039;s trip.<br>One time, I&#039;m free-diving at 50ft and quickly find a nice ab (11&quot;) and as I pop it up, I see a bigger one several feet over. I attempt to pry it up, bit was a little slow. The ab clamped down bit I had the leverage and after a few seconds I got it.<br>In the way back up, I realized it was a big mistake to get two on a dive at this depth. When I got to the surface, I swore off getting two at a time.<br>We get to shore and ranger-rick, who had been watching us from the cliff, greeted us. He was going to inspect our haul. We were legal. The size limit was like 7&quot; and our smallest one was like 9&quot;. When he saw my huge ab, he said he&#039;d never seen one this big. I think it was between 13-14 inches. Among my group of veteran divers, that was our record. (Pure luck... not skill)<br>As far as SCUBA went, not much there other than spending 45 minutes at 50ft and decompressing at 15ft was weird to do.

I haven&#039;t been to the mountains yet due to the time of year but from pictures I&#039;ve been shown by a friend and what I&#039;ve seen online it does look excellent and like it varies so my critique is correct for 6 months of the year at least.",,,,,,,,1612027674,,,1997459,,,,,,1997459,,,,,out

Angeles, San Bernardino, and Cleveland National forests are all very close and accessible. Fairly close to cities though, probably not great for stargazing.

Find a spot around the oyster bays or down from the kayak launch.

Tuff-Shed is a popular brand, and while it is cheaper to just buy the lumber yourself you’re really paying for the assembly (which is included in the price). They can be framed in a day with an experienced pair of guys. You can buy similar kits online, but the shipping might be costly and the assembly might be tough for one person with no experience.<br><br>They’re completely unfinished on the inside. It’s bare studs, no drywall or plaster, no kitchen to speak of, no interior doors (if it’s two rooms), no insulation, no electrical, no plumbing, and no HVAC. The outside is done though, as well as exterior windows and doors. <br><br>What your left with is a sturdy structure that will last a lot longer than a tent, and something future guests won’t mind staying in. The styling and outdoorsy feel then comes from decorations and finish work. <br><br>Because you’ll be doing a lot of the work yourself, you can customize the inside, and live in the structure while you complete it. Forget the tent; you could have the cabin framed in a weekend, put up a temporary electrical pole, run electrical, and insulate in a few days and be much more comfortable",,,,,,,,1612886869,,,2007510,,,,,,2007510,,,,,out

I&#039;d probably build several semi-permanent shelters varying in height where i&#039;d stay depending on the season. I&#039;d stay higher up in summer and closer to the valley in the winter (in some valleys the people living there leave during the winter so they&#039;d be empty).<br>How would I survive? I&#039;d definitely try catching some fish in the plentiful rivers, there&#039;s also some small lakes as well, but I wouldn&#039;t rely on fishing to survive.<br>The Ticino area is blessed with masses of chestnut trees, so I&#039;d try to collect as many as possible during fall and conserve them (I know how to do that).<br>Fall would definitely be an easy season, with all the stuff that&#039;s growing there. Hazelnuts, acorns, rosehip, sloe...I could even collect and dry stinging nettle seeds, those are very nutritious as well.<br>Mushrooms as well, those aren&#039;t very calorie-dense though.<br>If I can preserve enough food I should be able to make it through the winter and hopefully into late spring as well. I would eat the bulbs of wood garlic, the roots of dandelion and the rhizomes of cattail to get me through spring if I don&#039;t have anything left from fall.<br>Clean water wouldn&#039;t be an issue since the streams are very clean in the alps.<br>It honestly doesn&#039;t sound that hard to survive here.

I also have a waterproof bag and carry trash bags to put over my boots when I sleep in the bivy. In the summer I think it does get a little warm but I like bivys with the option for ventilation to help and a very light blanket if needed. I live in the north so in the summer it still gets hot but not like the south. If u want a lightweight option for the south do a hammock. Another advantage of a bivy is that it is a good 4 season option that works all year if u get a good one. Just like everything however it may not be for u especially if u r claustrophobic.

They were the option you took when a tent wouldn&#039;t be viable, or if you wanted something that was more ultralight. However, tents have gotten smaller and lighter since then, and most people will find the comfort of a single person tent worth the extra few ounces.<br><br>Bivvys exist to fill a niche. They&#039;re still good as emergency shelters that let you sleep anywhere, but they provide less protection from rain and the elements. Especially in wet and rainy weather, you&#039;ll want to pair most bivvys with an overhead tarp or rainfly of somekind (and for some people this defeats the purpose, as carrying a rainfly and bivvy can be close to the same size and weight as a tent). Otherwise its like sleeping pressed against the edge of your tent all night and you can expect to get wet. This isn&#039;t the case for all of them, and you&#039;ll have to do research for specific products, but most people recommend some kind of overhead protection nonetheless.<br><br>That also brings up the other main issue, which is breathability. Some come with nets to keep air through and bugs out but you can&#039;t always use it, and you&#039;ll find that breathing alone will moisten your entire sleep system.<br><br>I still think bivvys are decent and have some benefits. You have the option to have your sleep system in roll you can throw on the ground in no time if you don&#039;t want to keep everything in compression sacks. I also like knowing I&#039;ll never have to search hard for a place to sleep. And even though there are many high end/UL tents, bivvys are still the simpler and generally lighter option. Instead of bringing a separate rainfly, you can always find a poncho with grommets that can double as your overhead. Bring some rope and maybe stakes and you&#039;ll usually save weight by doubling a piece of gear.<br><br>Do your research before you buy.

I cant imagine how many will die a day, 30% fish loss is being conservative over a year. How in the fk do you feed that many fish? Did a quick search, about $140 to raise 100 tilapia to 1lb adult size. How much of that is after harvest? Half?

They depreciate a lot right off the bat, so buying someones mistake for a deep discount might be worth it. You can work out the kinks that way and decide if that trailer really is right for you before you dump $20k into a $10k trailer. Ultimately, go to some dealerships and sit in them. Take notes of what you like, what would be nice to have, whatever. It&#039;s a big investment that tanks when you try and sell it, so unless you come across a banging deal, take your time.

The problem is the platform your doing it on. These vans are 60 years old now and horrible. Electrical is shit, motors are shit, frame at this point is gonna be shit, etc. You&#039;d be much happier buying a vehicle that is newer. Many people use trucks with canopies on the back, but from personal experience, its pretty unpleasant and trucks are not cheap now-a-days.<br><br>Since any van that is going to be in working order is going to cost nearly 20k+, I&#039;d recommend buying something that would be a more reliable rig. I personally just got a brand new Subaru Impreza Hatchback that seems to be more than fine for car-camping/van life if needed. The good thing about the Subaru is, it only costed 23k new for a base. For AWD and a warranty, you cant beat that price.<br><br>If you want something that is going to have practical use and wont cost 3k-7k a year to own, I&#039;d recommend checking these options. All new so warrenties and hassle free<br> - Subaru Impezza hatchback (AWD, 20k new Base Model) (Can sleep me and im 6 foot)<br> - Subaru Crosstrek (AWD, 23k base)<br> - Ford Transit Connect (27k net new)<br> - Ford Ranger (27k net new + Canopy/Camper 1k-5k)<br>You could always get these a few years older with warrantees too and save 2-5k. Subaru is very good at pre-owned cars<br><br>If you REALLY want to &#039;also learn mechanics&#039;, you cannot go wrong with a 22r or 22re toyota truck from 1980-1991. But to be honest, dealing with the rust, parts, boomer tutorials on youtube, etc, gets annoying. I had a 1991 Nissan D21 pickup and manNnnn, its a simple truck, but HOLY fuck was it annoying. Even my 15 year old Toyota Tacoma was shitting out to age. <br><br>I get that you have dreams and asperations of being a cool hippie and explore, but it comes with some serious problems.

I grew up farming so I kinda have an idea how I want to get around certain things. For instance, selling hogs and piglets, calves, and lambs online and using that as a method to vet possible future customers for meat/dairy but just let select people know by word of mouth. Same thing with maybe doing a vegetable/fruit stand. I’m not really looking to “get away from it all” type of homestead I’m more of a person who was just raised with a certain lifestyle and set of skills and sort of ethos that I want to live by but getting bogged down in US regulations makes it really expensive and all but impossible for a small farm to remain profitable. You gotta hustle if you want to have a family farm this day and age. Whether it’s growing pot, side work hauling/cutting hay, trucking, or whatever don’t plan on buying a small farm and making a living selling conventional. I might go legit on selling cider if it gets big enough because MO liquor licenses are very affordable and loose, but that’s something to consider probably 10 years or do from now.",,,,,,,,1612543430,,,1985820,,,,,,1985820,,,,,out

Research the varieties you can grow in your area and if they are viable for oil. Next consider that oil is a very low yield process, meaning it take A LOT of olives to make a little oil. Then you need to look into the type and expense of a press. I’m not trying to discourage you but you should know that the path to olive oil is an arduous one. Olive trees are neat tho they live and produce forever and super ripe olives are fun to pelt people with (natures paint balls) overall I think right off the bat you might see more cash flow by going a brining route and doing table olives, not that this process is quick or easy necessarily, but the yields are 1:1, you process an olive you sell an olive.",,,,,,,,1612544258,,,1985820,,,,,,1985820,,,,,out

So you should be able to grow a good Riesling or Vinho Verde. With grapes you need to put big stakes in the ground and run wires between them so that the vines have something to grow on, but you should be able to find cuttings to grow clones from pretty easily.

There is a little sweet spot with RVs though, around 7-10 years old, where a year or two older doesn&#039;t matter that much, if you find something for a good deal (maybe needing some repair) you can fix it and use it for a year or two then sell for a profit. Have done it a few times with various trailers and made out on top each time. You have to find just the right deal though. You can often get them for cheaper becasue when people fall on hard times the first thing they sell is their RV. Unless it&#039;s someone upgrading a lot of people are selling because they need to sell or want it off their driveway. Sometimes you can scoop something cheap if you find the right seller who needs to sell. Just saying. I&#039;ve done it <br><br>The first time i did it i bought this tent camper off a single mother i was fucking on the side. she didn&#039;t think it worked so i got it for like 300$. Got it home and found out she was just missing some of the poles so I got some used ones and had a good condition camper. Camped it 2 years then sold for $2400<br><br>Since then i usually find a 20&#039; trailer from someone who needs to sell like i said above, then jew them down on price, fix and clean it up a little bit, camp the shit out of it, then sell in a year or two.

All in all its not an easy place to hike and even for experienced outdoors men its no walk in the park. <br><a href=""#p2008468"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;2008468</a><br>cant say i ve been in that region but i ve wandered those coast mountains near Terrace following the Skeena and there are some deep places out there.

Steelhead are really string so you wont be able to fight them effectively with a light rod. Its bad for you and for the fish. An 8wt can also be used for bass, pike, carp and many other desirable species. Fly fishing gear is a &quot;buy once, cry once&quot; kind of purchase. If you&#039;re really serious about fly fishing then buying a mid price (200-500$) rod and a decent reel (100-250$) is the best option. It will last you your whole life, if it doesn&#039;t it probably has a warranty, and you&#039;ll have no reason to upgrade in the future.",,,,,,,,1612583496,,,2000210,,,,,,2000210,,,,,out

People say it&#039;s super stable, but it would depend on weight and height I&#039;d imagine. Small isn&#039;t bad, but everyone has their preference. Gear could be tight depending on what you plan to bring. What you love others could despise and vice versa. If it&#039;s within your budget and will get you enjoyment on the water, it&#039;s worth the investment. If you can see it in person, go see it, ask to sit in it, try it out a bit and go with your instincts. You may decide it&#039;s worth spending a little more for more features, or you could find this to be the perfect fit for what you want. Advice is dangerous for the one giving it.

This is a $30 reel sold separately from a $20 rod, and gets you a lower quality reel with an acceptable quality drag and a rod that&#039;s not complete garbage, but isn&#039;t really the kind of rod you want to chase delicate bites or big fish with, because it&#039;s got a whippy tip and a soft backbone, which means that it doesn&#039;t do the best job transmitting the feel of the strike to your hand, but makes a great rod to keep behind the seat of a regular cab pickup to chase dink bass after work or toss bobbers at panfish to grab a fresh fish dinner after work.<br><br>The tier beyond that is things like the Cadence Amazon rods or no-name graphite rods, which are made with real rod features, but not real rod QC or quality, so you might get a good one and have it act like it&#039;s a decent rod but it&#039;d be better to save a little more for something nicer, or buy name brand fiberglass or fiberglass/carbon composite rods, like the Ugly Stick or the Shimano Sojourn (get the Sojourn). You can put the same kind of cheap reels on these as the other units, but get something nicer, like a Catana, or two steps nicer like a Sedona or President.<br><br>Then you get into the decent graphite rods or specialty fiberglass poles, like the Quantum QX36. These are rods that have most of the good features, and are good quality materials, but check for assembly problems. I don&#039;t like to buy these online, because I want to check the spine of the rod before I buy it, if the spine and the eyelets are properly aligned and there&#039;s no defects in the construction, they are great. A QX36 with a Sedona is a better combo than most fishermen own.",,,,,,,,1612759994,,,2000210,,,,,,2000210,,,,,out

Better feel and sensitivity lets to determine that you&#039;re getting a bite faster, giving you more time to set the hook before the fish spits your bait. Better casting distance lets you cover more water, which means you can find the fish faster or reach fish you otherwise could it.<br><br>Don&#039;t get me wrong, you can pick up a Disney Princess combo kit complete with the &quot;hide a hook&quot; no poke bobber and find a worm flipping rocks, and catch a fish in the runoff basin for the parking lot of the same walmart you bought the rod at, but you&#039;ll catch more, better fish with a little better gear.",,,,,,,,1612763696,,,2000210,,,,,,2000210,,,,,out

I was in Homochitto NF in Mississippi, hiking a 12 mile trail on a weekend. It’s rare to see anyone out there; MS has a low population and hiking isn’t exactly popular in that part of the country. The guy was in his late 20’s, no backpack, wearing casual clothes. He was barely off trail, and not being very conspicuous. Like, I was a good 100’ away when I saw him. <br><br>I just stopped and kind of hid behind a tree so he wouldn’t see me. Honestly I didn’t know what to do. Keep walking toward him? Call out and let my presence be known? I glanced over occasionally to see if the coast was clear. He moaned loudly when he was done, which I found odd. He walked the other way down the trail.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;gay fags blowing each other</span><br>This was at Clark Creek, a popular day hiking area near St. Francisville, LA. There are numerous waterfalls along a creek path, and a ~3 mile trail that meanders through very hilly mixed hardwoods and pine. No one bothers to hike that trail, as the waterfalls are the main attraction. The trail has a small shelter, about the size of a bus stop shelter, with a bench inside. It’s open on one side, facing away from the trail.<br><br>I was going up the hill and I saw someone kneeling in front of someone else. Like, it was obviously someone getting head. From the trail I could only see legs and feet. They heard me coming and stopped. They could have waited for me to pass or done the polite thing and asked me to join, but no, they left.

I will be precise with my information, events, and facts, but will try not to sacrifice the telling of the story in doing so.

Pohaturoa, located on the opposite bank of the Waikato River from State Highway 30, just outside of the hydro-dam town Atiamuri.

I will try not to colour it too much with any of my reflections, and just tell it as the images presented themselves.<br>From that moment I was looking out over the cliff at the sunset, the next I was looking down at myself from above. I remember seeing myself, my Bro, and Mate all sitting still with very stern expressions as we watched the sky. We were lit up red and gold with the light, and all over us were perched the fantails, more than there had been before, and all of them still and quiet, watching the sky just like we were. The scene then went dark as the sun vanished, and everything was cast in the deep red of the sky.<br>Next I was back in the perspective of my own body, but I do not recall being lucid in it, as it was like I was a passenger rather than driving. I have to emphasise how abstract and dreamy this all felt, things like perspective and geography were being warped for the sake of the images I was seeing. <br>I was again looking up at the sky, and the black rends that we had seen before were growing and merging until it split the sky, which exactly mirrored the black shape of the river below us. Out of that black river in the sky figures began to emerge, black silhouettes cast onto the red sky. They came out of the river and were at the banks. <br>Now the perspective shifted, and it’s like I was in the first person perspective of one of those people down on the river. We were on the banks looking up at Pohaturoa, pulling in canoes to the banks. The people looked like Maori, but they did not have facial tattoos, and their hair was dark red. I (or the body whose eyes I was seeing through) looked to where a large canoe was being pulled in, and a tall man who I knew was the chief of our people stepped out onto the bank and turned to a woman.",Pohaturoa7,.jpg,1200.0,1200.0,125.0,125.0,1610851997306.0,1610851997,MTAgecdO3bR7YMCWqOi8/w==,114389.0,1982424,,,,,,1982424,,,,,out

The Chief helped his wife from the canoe. The whole thing was very dignified.<br>Then I was again looking at the sky, and on the river were two groups of figures fighting.<br>Next I was again looking through that same figures eyes. I do not know how I know it was the same man. I could smell blood. There had been a battle on the river with people who were clearly Maori, and while the Maori had been defeated the tribe had also lost men. I was in a group of the red-headed tribesmen assembled at the house of the Chief, they were angry and gesturing to his Maori wife, who the Chief then relented and turned on. She looked very young then when the tribe of red-haired men came in on her.<br>Then the memories shift to being back looking at the sky. Now above the image of the river is the silhouette of Mount Pohaturoa, looking like a tombstone. And then from the <br>peripheries of the horizon blackness began to seep in in the shapes of hundreds of men with spears, and the smoky red sky surrounding the mountain was then alive like it was on fire. There was the sensation that everything was throbbing with the beat of drums.<br>Once again in the perspective of the tribesman, the drumming was as loud as if it was behind me, and I was climbing that steep gully up the side of the mountain just like I had before, only now my arms were brown and I was surrounded by other fleeing people all scrambling up the mountainside as something chased us. There was a heavy smell of smoke.

Only now the night was dark, there was no light but from the moon and stars. Me, Bro, and Mate were all still sat there as still as before, but the fantail that sat on us were not. They were squeaking and shaking their tails where they stood, staring behind us into the long grass.<br>Through the tribesman’s eyes I could only smell the scent of decay. I looked through the long grass to the edge of the summit and saw myself, Bro, and Mate all sat as we were before, covered in fantails. The sensation that something was coming up the mountain was stronger than ever, and then I was overcome by a certainty that whatever it was had arrived on the summit.<br>Looking down on the three of us again, the grasses to our backs were thrashing like several large crawling things were moving around the clearing of our camp, but every time they came close the fantails, now flashing all around us, would dart towards the scrub and whatever was in there would turn back for a moment.

For those who do not know the early polynesians in NZ at this time were nomadic, as they hunted the large native bird-fauna that had evolved here like Moa. The Moa Hunter cultures were defined by the fact that they were nomads, were far less material than later Maori culture, and they were far less violent. They had no reason to be with so much resources. When the moa began to die out the new waves of Polynesian settlers brought cultivated crops with them and started creating larger settled communities. With this settlement came competition for arable land and a more warlike culture.<br>I believe that the red-haired people I saw through the eyes of were the Moa Hunter tribe of that area, and that the Maori who came in were newcomers looking to gain influence in the area through a marriage of a chief&#039;s daughter to the chief of the Moa hunter tribe. And to back it up, I have the iwi&#039;s oral history that explains exactly that. This article goes into the local history and lines up with what I saw. <br>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/pohat<wbr>uroa-the-story-of-a-new-zealand-hil<wbr>l/SMUDRGLMU3HO6LWJJH6AMWWJHQ/<br> <span class=""quote"">&gt;Fletcher says they could barely be called a tribe to start with. More a collection of scattered families, they arrived in the area around 1400 and were known as the People of the Pumice Lands. Over the next 200 years, they lived in the area alongside the Ngati Hotu and Ngati Ruakopiri</span><br> <span class=""quote"">&gt;As with European monarchs, the hapu arranged a strategic alliance, marrying a chieftainess to a man of the Kahupungapunga for the sake of peace and access to the region&#039;s natural wealth. But the arrangement, it is said, turned sour</span>",,,,,,,,1611136377,,,1982424,,,,,,1982424,,,,,out

The Maori woman that I saw was obviously blamed for the attack by the moa hunters from what I had seen, and I figured she must&#039;ve been killed, but the way that they did it was so horrible it makes me sick and angry. According to the legend (source: same article):<br> <span class=""quote"">&gt;People here saw her as imposing their [Whaita and Waerangi] mana on them. They could see a loss of the area with more people coming in. They murdered her and made it look like an accident</span><br> <span class=""quote"">&gt;But the woman, most commonly thought to be named Kiroukore, had a slave. He discovered Kahupungapunga&#039;s treachery and carried the news back to Kawhia. The Raukawa hapus were furious and, that same day, gathered together a war party 500 strong. The warriors moved across the land, conquering several pa as they went. Finally they met the Kahupungapunga in a battle called Taurianuku</span><br>It doesnt say how she died, but there&#039;s a bit later on that stirred my memory:<br> <span class=""quote"">&gt;The pursuers crossed the stream to Pohaturoa, each party fought valiantly, the Ngatiwairangi were several times repulsed but in the end they drove back the others and captured their great toa [fighting chief] Hikaraupi. The great stones on which the bodies were cooked can be seen still</span><br>The rock in question is pic rel. It has many legends to its name, but one is that it was used to cook alive a Maori Princess. When i touched her hand all the skin on her had been stripped away and her bones were shiny like they&#039;d been boiled. Why they boiled her avile insteaad of outright killing her i dont know, but as far as I care those cunts got what they deserved for what they did to her. <br>I think that the things that were stalking us in the grass where the spirits of the Moa Hunters, and the spirt of the Princess had so much mana that they were afraid of her when she led us out.<br>Regarding the fantails, they are held by maori to be bodies that dead spirits can inhabit.

That&#039;s how I recall the noise right now.<br>When I heard it move, it sounded like a person taking a few steps--two--at a time. I actually thought I disturbed a neighbor and they were coming to see what was going on (I had my flashlight on) I 100% thought it was a human being until I heard the noise. Holy crap that noise was terrifying.<br>The noise sounded like a sniff, or I thought at first. Recalling it I know I am not remembering the noise 100% correctly but there was something strange to the noise as well, it wasn&#039;t like a dog sniff, but I could tell at the time it was a sniff, like an intake of air. Just not like any I&#039;ve heard before.<br>I hid my phone light so I wouldn&#039;t be seen as easily hopefully (I couldn&#039;t see anything anyway, but I didn&#039;t want to make my position completely obvious) and to focus on the noise. It didn&#039;t stop or anything, right now and for the entire rest of the story, except for when I started running. So constantly I am now hearing these steps, or something disturbing the leaves on the ground, maybe 30-40 meters up the hill if videogame knowledge of distance is accurate. I mean, holy crap when I went outside to start with there was no noise at all, anywhere.<br>OK so now that I&#039;ve gotten key details that were fresh in my memory at the time of writing let me go ahead and explain everything. <br>Basically, I&#039;ve taken an interest in the outdoors, but now after this I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m ngmi, but I think I have some reason to be as terrified as I am. When I first started, I had this big knife I was taking into the woods behind our house down to a little stream, I wanted to see if I could somehow learn to make a fire with just wood and ingenuity, (aided by Youtube) so I spent several days trying this, to no avail while I was waiting for matches to come in after ordering them online. Oh well, I had never actually started a fire before so it wasn&#039;t really a surprise, but practice didn&#039;t hurt I don&#039;t think.",,,,,,,,1612775619,,,1982424,,,,,,1982424,,,,,out

OK, so there might be an actual reason for this, I had read a 4chan story that was definitely fake about these murderous forest dwarves, and my imagination was running, so obviously I was probably just imagining it. Then I heard footsteps, and remembering this now sends chills up my spine, but down by the stream I begun hearing footsteps. I say footsteps because if it was a squirrel or something hopping around, why would it always be two crunches of leaves? Crunch, crunch. Stop. Later--crunch crunch again. If I was out in the woods walking, if I take a step, my other foot needs to move up as well to get anywhere. That was what it sounded like. Every now and then I&#039;d stop working and listen and DEFINITELY NOT IMAGINING IT HEAR THIS NOISE. I wasn&#039;t too worried then because it was broad daylight, I had a big knife, and really during this entire time of the whole story I&#039;m telling I wasn&#039;t not within a minute or two sprint from my house. Anyway, after hearing this noise twice, one day after the other, I stopped going even so far as the stream. It was a lot quieter over there and I had stopped feeling comfortable down there. So instead I started working at a halfway point between the house and the stream. A lot more comfortable, I didn&#039;t hear the noise at all then the few days I was out there.",,,,,,,,1612775690,,,1982424,,,,,,1982424,,,,,out

My friends and I like to play videogames late, so I figured I&#039;d just go outside (after all it&#039;s not even far from the house at all) and I didn&#039;t tell my parents or anyone what I was gonna do. So at 2 AM I go outside in the pitch dark with my stuff and my flashlights, and I head out into the dark. After all, what&#039;s going to happen? I&#039;m going to be eaten by wolves? I was really stupid because it&#039;s honestly not outside of the realm of possibility that a bear was out there. We get bears out here. I&#039;m a moron. Anyway, I just figure I&#039;ll be fine and start my fire quick enough and nothing will bother me and I&#039;ll go to sleep in my bag. Definitely not what happened. I get to where I have wood stored dry in case it had rained today (thank goodness it didn&#039;t) which also happens to be the site of where I am going to start a fire and unroll my sleepy bag. At this point, I&#039;m already feeling weird because I was shining a light out here at 2 AM and I realized I could see lights from where my neighbors lived, so if any of them were outside they would see me and possibly not realize it was me and not an intruder or something. So I&#039;m just like, &quot;OK, if anyone starts coming to shoot a robber or something I&#039;ll yell and tell them it&#039;s me.&quot;",,,,,,,,1612775759,,,1982424,,,,,,1982424,,,,,out

Oh, it was me dropping that and it created an echo. I&#039;ll try not to do that again.&quot; I thought. I lift literally one more and then dogs start barking. So I guess maybe that was my fault, but who knows because dogs bark at everything, and their barking was far off anyway, so it could have been anything. And then, as the dogs are barking I hear somebody walking towards me. I am thinking in this moment I actually disturbed a neighbor and feeling kind of bad about it, but amazed, because I went out there trying to be as quiet as possible. Then I heard that fucking noise from the same spot. Holy shit that noise. It instantaneously set me on edge, and I started thinking about the wendigo, and the murder dwarfs. OK, but to think logically for a moment, it obviously wasn&#039;t the murder dwarfs or there would be a lot more footsteps, and the murder dwarfs were from a fake story set in Alaska, OK, BUT IT OBVIOUSLY WASN&#039;T A FUCKING NEIGHBOR. Whatever the fuck was out there was an animal, and I swear to fuck it was sniffing. Note that this doesn&#039;t rule out the wendigo, so that&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking of right now. Remember, it&#039;s two crunches of leaves, and a sniff. I distinctly remember that happening in various orders. Crunch crunch, sniff. Sniff. Crunch crunch. Crunch crunch. Sniff. That&#039;s what it was like. Now as I am writing this story I am wondering what is the possibility this was just one of our cats, but that&#039;s the thing, I&#039;m around cats a lot, THEY DON&#039;T SNIFF LIKE THIS OR THAT LOUD.

I take out my knife, and realize if it came to fighting some sort of predator capable of harming me, the best I would be able to do is kill it as it killed me. Not exactly what I wanted. I don&#039;t have my light on right now, if I turn on my light it sees me, (I had turned it off when heard the stepping) and if I move it hears me, if I wait, it potentially comes close to me. Not desirable. What do? My first thoughts: getting on the phone and calling my dad who was probably still awake, or yelling loudly to hopefully scare off the thing. I realized in that moment my pride was deadly, because I would literally rather be killed by a wendigo than suffer the humiliation of calling my dad or waking the neighbors because I was being a scared pussy. So then I decided I would run for it, I would leave my sleeping bag and other stuff, most of which is out there protected from rain, so it should be fine, but I drew my knife and turned on my flashlight. It surely knew where I was anyway, so if it was actually something dangerous it was either escape or fight at that point.",,,,,,,,1612775887,,,1982424,,,,,,1982424,,,,,out

I chose escapefight and prepared to die fighting if it came to it while running away. I ran up the hill TOWARDS the noise, and passed what I am pretty sure was a squirrel which I shined my light on as I ran past and I think I said &quot;Get out of here!&quot; as it scuttered away. As a ran I wondered if the entire time I was being spooked by a fucking squirrel, and maybe the &quot;sniff/clack&quot; noise was it biting a nut or something. I&#039;m not about to go outside before the sun is bright to find out though. Also, the squirrel was RIGHT on the edge of the path, which is closer, but not too far, from where I think the noise was. So you know, there&#039;s a good chance it was the damn squirrel and I&#039;m just not gonna make it outdoors, but I also believe it might not have been. I still want to sleep outdoors, but I don&#039;t want to do it anywhere near my house though. Also I wonder if my gear is gonna be disturbed at all. I should probably just get a tent, a gun, and start the fire before it&#039;s dark.<br><br>So what was the dumbest thing I did?

I ran a MeetUp group with &gt;120 people, and that was about the average size, maybe bigger now that I think about it.<br><br>I say “want” rather than “need” because the largest varying factor is the weather. If you’re expecting rain on day two, you’ll need room in your pack for rain gear. For cooler temps you’ll have more layers. Sometimes you’ll have both. If it’s never raining or cold, you can get away with a smaller pack, but that seriously limits when you can go. Sometimes the weekend looks great except for a brief period with a 40% chance of rain. Good thing you opted for the larger pack and can fit rain gear, right?<br><br>That’s also what determines what you bring on longer trips. Food obviously, but extra layers for that one day where the temps dip a little low takes up a ton of space. And bad weather is more likely over a longer period of time. <br><br>Less expensive gear (particularly sleeping bags) don’t compress nearly as much as expensive down bags. And bags for cold weather are much larger.",,,,,,,,1611932718,,,1987000,,,,,,1987000,,,,,out

Start with every strap loose. With the pack hanging from your shoulders, bend at the waist, hoist your pack up so the hip belt rides at your hips, and buckle then tighten it. Straighten up and tighten the shoulder straps. You want them snug; just tight enough to wear they take a minimal amount of weight. Most of the weight will be on the hip belt.

Sleeping bags are responsible for the bulk of space taken up inside a bag. the only other thing I can think of that eats that much space is a tent. Attaching a sleeping bag to the outside of the bag allows for more to be carried without throwing off your balance too much, assuming it&#039;s a light bag weight-wise, and allows you to carry it without scrunching it down which improves on the life span of it because down eventually goes bad(from what I&#039;ve learned from here, at least, it goes bad from being compressed so it&#039;s better to hang it or store it in a large net bag).",,,,,,,,1612686023,,,1987000,,,,,,1987000,,,,,out

Thing is, you don&#039;t really need a lot of equipment to start with astrophotography. If you buy used you can find a tracker and an already modified camera with an okayish lens for less than a thousand dollars. Spending more money will mostly get you clear images faster because noise in images will get less with dedicated astro cameras and with better tracking/guiding you wont have to rule out many of the subframes because of star trailing.<br>Atm I use an iOptron CEM25P, with a high quality 250mm lens at F/4.9 and a modified Sony a6000, so no dedicated camera yet. All that with a small autoguiding setup. For the nebula images I usually use a Ha-filter.<br>Because 250mm is not a very long focal length I ordered a new telescope at 600mm because I realized I like capturing details more than those widefield images. Next thing will be a dedicated, cooled astro camera, but they are extremely expensive, so I have to save up for a decent one.<br>The camera itself didn&#039;t cost me anything. Got it as a gift from my dad a while ago. When I started with this hobby, I modified it myself, so I only had to pay like 60 bucks for a new UV-IR block filter. You can get that done by someone else if you&#039;re too afraid to kill your camera but I found a decent tutorial online so I did it on my own.<br><br><a href=""#p1996148"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;1996148</a><br>Thank you for your kind words anon. For me it&#039;s an extremely rewarding hobby, its really incredible what you can capture from your backyard. Some people will say you could just look at the same images in better quality online, which is true, but taking them yourself is a totally different feeling. Also it&#039;s very challenging so being rewarded with a finished picture after 20+ hours of work is absolutely fantastic. I can understand how astronomy might seem expensive and the photography part truly is, but visual is quite affordable.",IMG_20200901_164540_989,.jpg,4840.0,3296.0,125.0,85.0,1611820200859.0,1611820200,SUWtJOThNNtGXix11wBD7Q==,4308269.0,1980831,,,,,,1980831,,,,,out

Unfortunately not, to capture good pictures of planets you need a totally different setup than for capturing deep sky objects. You need a really high focal length to capture planets, somewhere in the 2000+mm range and a camera that can record with a high framerate. To make good planetary images you record a video of the planet and a software will take the best frames of that video and produce a clear and detailed picture. Thats done to eliminate the blurines caused by air turbulence.<br>My setup is for a very wide field of the sky the full moon would actually fit in the frame a few dozen times, so planets would pretty much look like stars aswell.<br>But have a picture of the moon I took with my phone and my 8&quot; dobsonian I use for visual astronomy. But desu it&#039;s not great, you can see it even better if you&#039;re looking at it directly, the human eye does a great job at filtering out the air wobbling, cameras not so much.<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Tl;dr</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;don&#039;t have the right equipment for planetary photography, but have a bad pic of the moon</span>",20200311_220337-01,.jpg,3056.0,3055.0,125.0,124.0,1611837473991.0,1611837473,59vmckabiDUMMrHL+2EbUw==,729541.0,1980831,,,,,,1980831,,,,,out

When doing visual astronomy you&#039;ll almost never see any colour, except for some stars, the part of your eye responsible for seeing in the dark can only see black and white. If you went to a spot with actually zero light pollution, you should be able to see the milky way quite well, with some dust bands clearly visible. But there are multiple things that can impact how good you can see it. Did your eyes fully dark adapt, so no looking at any kind of light for 20 minutes. Did you go during summer when the bright core of the milky way rises to its highest spot? Are there any cities in the south from your viewing spot, that create a light dome? Also remember, you&#039;re in the northern hemispere and the brightest part of the milky way never goes up near zenith, so to get the best views you need to be in the southern hemisphere",,,,,,,,1612254861,,,1980831,,,,,,1980831,,,,,out

Here&#039;s what I would&#039;ve suggested to myself:<br><br>First, accumulate a library of books and charts. If you&#039;re excited to just be able find all the different constellations and objects of special interest with the naked eye, then that&#039;s a sign that you&#039;ll enjoy astronomy.<br><br>Second, use binoculars you already own or purchase some. I truly believe that you will buy binoculars eventually whether or not you buy a telescope. The whole point of the binoculars is not to see higher magnification, it is to boost the brightness of the stars. I recommend getting something 8x40, small and light. Using the binoculars in conjunction with your planisphere and atlases will help you figure out the sky and where everything is better.<br><br>I personally use my Pentax 6.5x21 binos I already had laying around. You might be thinking to yourself, ain&#039;t those too small? No! They boost my eye&#039;s ability to see faint stars by 3~4x. Think about it this way, your pupils probably dilate to about 5mm wide and if you&#039;re young and perfectly dark-adapted, you&#039;ll get 7mm max. Well these tiny binos of mine have a 21mm aperture. Imagine if your pupil dilated to 21mm, that&#039;s how good your night vision would be. So yes, don&#039;t knock small binos for serious star gazing.<br><br>My first day of using my telescope, I was like what the fuck is all this shit. I didn&#039;t even know what to point my telescope at. My first session I spent looking at the sky with the naked eye, having FUN just figuring out which constellation was which. I didn&#039;t even need my telescope. The telescope magnification is just too much and trying to center an object in the sky was difficult because mine didn&#039;t come with a finder scope. (had to use the built-in peep sights)<br><br>So that&#039;s my last piece of advice, make sure your telescope comes with a decent, wide field finder scope.",,,,,,,,1612907233,,,1980831,,,,,,1980831,,,,,out

This is kinda overkill, but if you have the cash to spend and you want something that isn&#039;t cheap plastic (the entire telescope and mount and tripod are fully metal), I&#039;d recommend this one. It&#039;s Made in Japan, so you know it&#039;s good :^)<br><br>My personal recommendation for telescopes in general, apart from my aforementioned luxury purchase, is to get something that isn&#039;t under $200. From my research, no entry level scope that&#039;s actually good is sold for less than $200 unless it&#039;s just the tube and it&#039;s on special or something. At the bare minimum range, I would highly consider the Orion StarBlast 4.5, comes in both tabletop and EQ mount options (for the same price).<br><br>I would likewise recommend binoculars from reputable optics manufacturers such as Pentax, Nikon, or Canon. Based on my research, other lesser bino manufacturers fudge their binoc numbers. Oberwerk, despite being a highly rated brand among astronomer community, is particularly egregious. Their 8x52 is actually 8x40 and their 8x40 is actually 8x32.<br><br>And finally, the best reason to start with the binocs first is that ALL the good telescopes on online stores are SOLD OUT.

Then, while making little circles, pull your knife across the stone. You&#039;re gonna want some lubrication on there as well. I&#039;ve always used water, but even spit will work in a pinch. But if you want to be really fancy they make oils and stuff as well. Make sure you sharpen both sides of the knife the same number of times. I do twenty times for each side on the coarse side of the stone, then repeat on the fine side. I know people like to get fancy and get a 600 dollar stone and 40 dollar lubricants, But my dads 20 dollar whetstone from Menards and regular tap water has always worked for me and it always passes the paper test when I&#039;m done.

There&#039;s a particularly tall mountain near me that&#039;s on private property, but the owner would let people go up if they could find and stay on the trail to the summit. You had to pour over topograhical and satelite maps for hours to know about the trail. There was even a guest book for the people who made it, almost nobody ever signed it because it very few people knew about the trail or how to access it. All this changed a few years ago when too many people started going onto his land and the increase in hikers caused all sorts of damage to his property he closed off the trail and replaced the guest book with a &quot;tresspassers will be shot&quot; sign.

This is always the best option if you have the time and resources. Bonus points if you can make your own handle.

Could probably power through a weekend trip but if you camp frequently it will quickly fall behind the competition. Assume around $15-25.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Fiskars </span><br>Also makes cheap hatchets/axes. Can&#039;t say I&#039;ve used them myself but I&#039;ve seen decent reviews for them. Could be worth looking into, especially if you prefer fiberglass handles.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Council tools</span><br>Another decent brand with good reviews. They have axes that fall right around that $50 mark and their website has a decent enough variety. Always do your own research, but this might be your best bet for something that&#039;s quality enough at the budget you gave. Then again I could be wrong and quality could have nosedived at some point.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Husqvarna</span><br>If you&#039;re willing to stretch your budget a bit more I&#039;d also look towards Husqvarna (specifically wood handled selections). They come pretty close to the &quot;high-end&quot; axes for around half the price. A nice middle ground option if you can afford the extra $30-50.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Estwing</span><br>Uncomfortable and clunky. I do not understand how having a single piece of steel could benefit anybody but the manufacturer. This stupid decision destroys the handling, comfort, and durability of their products.

All of these in my experience are well made, durable, quality products. I’m not a big fan of plastic, so the cups, bowls and utensils included in the Stanley sets don’t get much use (although they’re actually pretty ok) If you’re looking to upgrade from non stick aluminum, any of these brands should fill the bill. I’ve also got an MSR non stick aluminum set and while it’s a great piece of lightweight kit, it just feels weak compared to my SS and I end up babying it cuz I’m always worried that I’m going to fuck around and scratch the non stick coating.<br><br>As I said above, I’m not a big fan of plastic.

But it&#039;s nice to be able to cook properly on a fire in the forest while snow is falling.,,,,,,,,1611848300,,,1985375,,,,,,1985375,,,,,out

Gasoline has quite a bit more btu’s per pound than alcohol fuels and it’s heat output is roughly equivalent to propane &amp; butane. In rural areas, availability of fuel can be a concern when using an alcohol or butane stove but gasoline is ubiquitous. Also with it’s burner being low to the ground and having wide legs, this stove is much less prone to tipping over. The design does have some disadvantages compared to those using disposable butane / propane canisters. It is larger, and heavier plus having a separate burner &amp; pump connected by a hose can make storage in a backpack more awkward.<br><br>There’s nothing wrong with this stove design. Like any stove, it has it’s own advantages and disadvantages.

You’re basically done. Let it rest until it doubled in volume, fold it and let it rest again. Bake for 50-60 min in a dutch oven at 450f and let it rest for just as long before slicing it.<br>They say to let the dough initially rise for 8-12 hours at room temp, so if it gets cold at night outdoors, maybe you should mix it in the morning and bake in the eve instead of letting it rise overnight like you would normally do indoors. I like to put a damp rag on top of the bowl while it’s rising to keep shit from getting in the dough and the moisture content high, otherwise a dry skin can form at the surface. That’s no biggie and you can always fold it back in but i’d rather avoid it altogether if I can. Obviously, it’s going to bake much faster over coals in a lidded pot than in a dutch oven at home, so I half the recipe and make smaller buns when I’m out. Keep an eye on it, don’t let it burn, adapt to the circumstances and trust your experience or instinct if you have none. It’s really rewarding",,,,,,,,1612025644,,,1985375,,,,,,1985375,,,,,out

After reading your previous comments I’m not sure you’re intelligent enough to actually understand anything you read so I’ll spell it out for you. Yes, the burn bans in Canada are put in place regionally due to local conditions and the availability of firefighters. (This is the way it works in the USA as well as Europe. ) In Canada, a burn ban is referred to as a Restricted Fire Zone. If you violate these bans you can be fined, jailed and required to pay any costs incurred if your fire causes damages. The reason you can be fined or jailed is because violating a ban by building a campfire in an RFZ is illegal you fucking moron.",278B9748-ED45-4938-9DC7-20266C132DD4,.jpg,1242.0,1124.0,125.0,113.0,1612201778613.0,1612201778,Xkj0oMJQgQ5ebxgFFp+1NQ==,319760.0,1985375,,,,,,1985375,,,,,out

When the ambient temp is lower than the boiling point of the gas, it will have 0 psi of pressure.<br><br>You *are* partially correct about turning the canister upside down to increase cold weather performance but the reason for this is due to the fact that gases cool as they expand and when a substance undergoes a phase change from a liquid to a gaseous state the expansion and resulting drop in temperature is massive. When the canister is upright, this phase change takes place inside the canister which causes the temperature of the liquid fuel to drop below the ambient air temp. If the ambient temp is close to the boiling point of the fuel, this expansive cooling can drop the fuel’s temp below it’s boiling point and it’s vapor pressure will fall to zero. When a canister is upside down, liquid fuel flows out and the phase change takes place just past the valve so the temp of the fuel inside the canister stays relatively the same.<br><br>Hope this clears up any misunderstanding.",,,,,,,,1612681928,,,1985375,,,,,,1985375,,,,,out

Too tight of a pack is a common reason for a pipe going out because tobacco expands when lit. Instead try packing using the German/Frank method. It&#039;s a gravity fill followed by a pinch of tobacco to create a plug in the top part of the pipe while keeping the bottom part loose. For humidity, do the pinch test. Pinch a bit of tobacco between your index and thumb. If it crackles and crumbles it&#039;s too dry, if it sticks together it&#039;s too wet. You want it to crackle slightly and puff back up after pinching. Don&#039;t underestimate the importance of a false light and getting a good cherry going. Aromatics and flake cut blends often burn worse by the way, try a non aromatic ribbon cut for the best chances of good and even burn.",,,,,,,,1610483485,,,1971522,,,,,,1971522,,,,,out

There&#039;s several different types of filters such as paper, balsa wood and activated charcoal. A filter can restrict draw, reduce smoke harshness, regulate moisture and prevent ash/bits of tobacco from getting in your mouth. The degree to which it does any of these things depend on the type of filter and its quality. A really bad filter can the restrict draw too much and even change the taste of the tobacco. For instance, I have these White Elephant charcoal filters that clog up my entire pipe. On the other hand, a good filter can reduce the harshness so that the flavor comes through, cool down the smoke and reduce moisture if you&#039;re prone to pipe gurgling because you&#039;re a drooling retard like myself. I&#039;d recommend trying all three types and see what you like. Personally, I use balsa wood filters for the cob and activated charcoal filters for the briar pipe.",,,,,,,,1611481591,,,1971522,,,,,,1971522,,,,,out

The correct name for this product really is just moist snuff, but the translation from “snus” to English was unsophisticated and varied from brand to brand. In certain places in America, any smokeless oral tobacco was called “chew”, but this is incorrect.<br>Chewing tobacco is just tobacco that you chew. In America, this is usually scraps of sweetened leaf that you gnaw on to moisten it up, and then stick it in your cheek. Dip is used more or less like snus, put into the divot of the upper or lower lip. In Europe, chewing tobacco also exists, but usually as twisted rope (sold as-is in certain parts of England, and sold as small cuts of rope in a tin or pouch in continental Europe).<br>Chew used to be FAR more popular than dip, but USST (United States Smokeless Tobacco, the manufacturer of Copenhagen and Skoal) made a huge advertising push starting in the 70’s, and the market has since shifted. In its current form, it’s one of the newest ways of using tobacco.<br><br>Here’s an example of USST’s marketing push, exemplified by a free sample offering at a mall https://youtu.be/N9T83iPWuO8<br><br>Source: I make videos exclusively about making your own smokeless tobacco and its history",D00E2A10-FC11-4F88-9B28-E6D4D80C04E9,.jpg,3264.0,2448.0,125.0,93.0,1612213547285.0,1612213547,ykrBe0aUJomcJCekZPVPvg==,879136.0,1971522,,,,,,1971522,,,,,out

I saw oysters selling locally for $12/pound, I figure on charging $10 and assuming a biological efficiency of just 100% that&#039;s a great way to turn $4 of straw into $500 (minus spawn and supplementation, lets call it $450 for more honest representation).

The curing process basically removes one carboxyl group from the ibotenic acid molecules, which converts them into muscimol, and the theory is that the CO2 present in carbonated drinks will reconvert it back into ibotenic acid.

They had a vibrant commercial economy, with lots of long-distance trade, periodic marketplaces, and professional merchants. They had two types of money. But they didn’t use wheeled carts.<br><br>The surprising thing is that the Mesoamericans DID invent the wheel. They made wheeled toys – mostly small clay animals with holes in the legs for an axle and wheels. These were most abundant in sites of the Toltec period (AD 900-1100), including Tula in central Mexico.<br><br><br>When the Spanish arrived from Europe in the sixteenth century they were astounded at the remarkable skills exhibited by the architects, builders and craftsmen of the ‘New World’. The calendar developed by the ancient Maya was more accurate than the calendar in use throughout Europe and the medical system in place among the residents of Mesoamerica was superior to that of the Spanish.<br><br>Yet, for all the advanced thinking, there was no utilitarian wheel; no carts, no wagons, no potter’s wheel. Still the concept of the wheel was known throughout Mesoamerica.<br><br>Archeologists have recovered numerous wheeled toys, very much like those still made today for children. These toys were what we would call “pull toys” and they were generally made of fired clay in the form of an animal (real or imagined) standing on a platform supported by four ceramic wheels. A loop for the pull string was usually made around the neck or head of the creature.<br><br>And yet, while the idea of the wheel was in place there were no wheeled vehicles.&quot;<br><br>And nobody knows how.

There was actually a disinformation campaign in the 60’s spread by the government and media to keep people off of the interstates.

California is the most populous state by far, and when it comes to hiking opportunities it’s miles beyond the next few populous states. Like, it’s not even close. So you have millions of people who hike all concentrated in a place that goes through a binary rain cycle; it’s very wet in the winter then a virtual drought the rest of the year. In a place like that, sure, you can get away with a tent that might not even be waterproof.

It&#039;s kind of a preference thing really, though the main objective benefits of sleeping bags over quilts are more applicable to extremely cold temperatures. Of course there are subjective differences which can make your mind up either way. Imo top quilts make the most sense in a hammock with a full length underquilt. <br><br>On a traditional tent setup, your pad covers 1 of your 4 sides (front, back, left, right), so your bag/quilt has to cover the other 3. One of the downsides of a quilt is that it lets drafts in from the sides. With a hammock, the underquilt is covering 3 of your 4 sides and you only really need something to cover the top of you, so a topquilt really shines here.

The footbox just keeps things tidy and aligned for getting in and if you move around. You can even get a cheap down or synthetic down camping quilt and just add some velcro or some snap closures if you&#039;re feeling snazzy. For hammock camping, I normally just unzip my sleeping bag, the zipper and hood aren&#039;t annoying enough and I only do like 1 or 2 trips cold enough with the hammock to worry about that. The only reason to go away from the current bag is if it&#039;s inadequate for other uses or reasons.<br><br>bottom<br>i really don&#039;t like pads in the hammock, they slide around, they get wet from condensation when i use them. Sub-optimal in my opinion, but fine for me since i use them only for 1-2 trips. Most of the time i just tie a synthetic blanket onto my ridgeline so it wraps underneath and rests just below me with me in the hammock. not even a really underquilt set-up, but it&#039;s good to about 60F.

You can get an alright underquilt for $300AU, though the really nice quilts are like $350US+ and you pretty much need to buy from a cottage company or DIY if you want something really nice. If you DIY it, $300AU will get you a really nice ultralight underquilt, though you will need a sewing machine. <br><br>If you want to buy a tent, consider you&#039;ll also need a sleeping pad (which you may already have) and you might be wanting something not inexpensive, like a Thermarest, if you want to trim the weight down and remain comfortable. Though you can get a CCF mat for like $20. I have no idea what kind of tent you can get with that money. My knowledge of tents is pretty much &quot;Vango are okay but not amazing and you&#039;ll spend £80-120, or there&#039;s fancy as shit Hillebergs if you&#039;re megabucks&quot;. I&#039;ve been using hammocks for about 9 years now. By my reckoning, hammock setups are lighter than tent setups*, but you invest a lot into your quilts; fancy as shit hammocks can be really cheap, or you can make them yourself really easily (They&#039;re literally just a rectangle with a cord channel in either end, and then some bugnet over the top... Even buying fancy Ripstop By The Roll printed ultralight fabric is going to put your costs under $100US). Tent setups seem to be more about investment into the tent itself, and then you just get a &quot;good&quot; sleeping bag and pad.. though take that with a huge pinch of salt, I really don&#039;t know shit about tents. <br><br>* my hammock, cordage, bugnet and tarp weigh in at ~1kg and they pack down really small. They cost me £140, together. When I did look into buying a tent about 6 years ago, buying a comfortable tent for this weight wasn&#039;t possible in this price range (though I could be wrong). Even a £660 hilleberg 3-season tent comes in at 1.2kg (their lightest 3-season tent). <br><br>The quilts come to about 1.2kg, which is comparable to a pad+top quilt setup used with a tent.",,,,,,,,1612837831,,,2006996,,,,,,2006996,,,,,out

In my opinion most of the best hiking is on the Arizona Trail. It is just so well maintained. It is difficult to really get way out there in the wilderness and still be on a decent trail. I recommend doing some sections in the Catalina mountains near Tucson, Four Peaks Wilderness and The Mazatzals. There is also very good and reliable water resources on the AZT. Download the AZT trail on Guthooks and you can read where water caches are and the status of collection tanks.<br><br>Other great options off the AZT are in the San Francisco peaks (hike up Humphrey&#039;s Peak, the Kachina trail is very nice), Sedona area (Sycamore Canyon is nice and very remote, but no well maintained trails), then of course there is the Grand Canyon (be sure to research permits regarding the National Park before going, it is nearly impossible to camp in the canyon without applying a year in advance).<br><br>Good day hikes around Phoenix are Weavers Needle, South Mountain, Camelback Mountain and Piestewa Peak. I have hiked up and down Piestewa and Camelback to many times to count, such amazing exercise right in the city. <br><br>Also, Flagstaff is going to be probably the best place to park your van.

The plurality of those migrants have moved to Texas, as many as 70,000 in 2011 and 60,000 in 2012. Given this influx of new residents, we are fortunate to have at times asked our respondents whether they have moved to Texas from California, and though the actual number of these people is but a small subsample of our surveys, we have enough respondents to make two broad conclusions. First, these newcomers, on average, tend to be conservative. Pooling data from the May 2012 and February 2013 UT/Tribune surveys, we found that 57 percent of these California transplants consider themselves to be conservative, while only 27 percent consider themselves to be liberal (a fair guess as to the margin of error is somewhere around +/- 7 percentage points). Second, these new Texans aren’t rushing to find homes in the state’s urban centers: 55 percent are heading to the suburbs, the rest evenly dividing themselves between rural and urban locations.",,,,,,,,1611932685,,,1978976,,,,,,1978976,,,,,out

10756,2004209,,,02/05/21(Fri)22:35:17,Anonymous,,"So I have been raising and breeding chickens specifically suited to colder climates post SHTF for 15 years now hoping to produce a fairly large fowl with moderate growth and fair egg production. I&#039;ve gotten fairly close, my main focus at the moment is cleaning up some color irregularities that pop up and trying to improve combs on the birds (I am breeding for rose combs but have been getting off combs in maybe 10% of birds yet). However with the covid panic I&#039;ve been thinking maybe I&#039;m misguided (I&#039;m still going to keep working on the project because it&#039;s a great way to separate fools from their money) it seems to me that the real solution is bantams following along the same lines as my large fowl. Something that can produce some degree of meat and egg but doesn&#039;t have the same feed and space costs as large fowl. What are your thoughts on this? Would it behoove me to start obtaining bantam stock and working towards a larger but still bantam class birds that will have above average musculature while maintaining a fair rate of lay? For reference my current birds are cocks averaging 8 pounds at 16 weeks finishing at around 15 pounds at 18 months and hens weighing 12 pounds laying at about 190 eggs a year and go broody at the drop of a hat if left to set eggs.",,,,,,,,1612582517,,,2002522,,,,,,2002522,,,,,out

As it stands now there is a lot of debate as to what the best breed is for SHTF, but there is no one breed that is yet to be declared the winner. I aim to market these birds as the winner and make a decent amount of money off paranoid fools. Realistically very similar birds could be obtained by running any larger breed of cock (I originally started with langshans) over some dark cornish hens, but the kind of person who is buying a SHTF chicken wouldn&#039;t know that.",,,,,,,,1612595735,,,2002522,,,,,,2002522,,,,,out

I did that shit through a heatwave, with nothing but a rake, pitchfork, shovel and a wheelbarrow. They had to pickup labour hire through an employment agency as we where too short staffed to help - 6 fucking guys (experienced landscapers) came in and quit during that project alone, none of them could handle it. I&#039;d go home black head to fucking toe covered in mulch dust every afternoon. I remember picking up 150-200l trees by hand, 6 at a time because thats all our shitty little truck with 500k kilometers on the clock and no windows could handle. We threw those trees in, 30 per day, dug the holes by hand through old limestome and roadbase. One day it was 47 degrees, I remember drinking 8 litres of water and 3 gatorades and I didn&#039;t piss a drop. All sweat. Project took 6 weeks in total, but I didn&#039;t crack. Didn&#039;t whinge. And sure enough it finished amazing, the bosses where stoked. The client was so happy we did it all again on another road a week later. But I&#039;d earned my stripes, and things got better.

You are just slave labour 90% of the time. If you&#039;re a halfwit you can start your own ventures and make easy $ that way - most the boys I worked with did that. It&#039;s the only way to make a real living. But one or two good clients can net you big bucks, cash in hand, for fuck all work. I&#039;m personally out the game. Nearly lost a finger at work and decided fuck it, time to move onto bigger things. But I don&#039;t regret doing any of it. Brutal manual labour teaches you a lot about yourself. It gives you strength and resolve most faggot NEETs never get a handle on. It&#039;s worth doing for that alone, irrespective of any career goals you have.

Private work for homeowners is where it&#039;s at, they provide you with anything you need and always pay well, and will be lenient with breaks and such as long as you get shit done. The big projects like water features are a lot more fun this way too.<br>Real landscaping companies are usually shit. Long days, no breaks except lunch, usually back breaking work with lots of repetitive motion, like weeding, hauling, pruning, etc. If you are going for this try and be one of the guys who mows, it&#039;s the cushiest thing in these companies. You just ride around the property listening to music or a podcast. <br>If you don&#039;t care about landscaping itself and just wanted to work with plants, I recommend green house.",,,,,,,,1612726247,,,1990429,,,,,,1990429,,,,,out

You might not like it but it’s still true. What you should do it be curious. What’s around, under, and above you? Learn about clouds and weather, try to identify those you see and make predictions. Learn about stars, try to identify constellations and to orient yourself. Teach yourself some commonly used knots and try out some pioneering and woodcraft to make your camp a bit more comfortable. What about the soil under your feet? Do you know it’s composition or about the rock formations in your area? Digg around for cool looking rocks and identify those too. Maybe you’ll come across some tracks while you’re doing that. Are those animal or insect tracks? Well learn about that too, sketch them, maybe even make some plaster casts if you can. You seem to imply you already know about plants and mushrooms, so you could start sketching specimens just to see if you can identify them later in books from your drawings. Another fun thing I’ve started to get into is making maps of my campsites and surroundings. I’ve come across a book about animal tracking that recommended doing one to have a better understanding of the animals around you. Start from the centre, using some landmark like a big boulder or a tree, and walk 100 paces in each direction to make a circular map. take notes of vegetation, topography, trails and tracks, streams, marshes, lakes, etc.<br>If none of that seems to tickle your fancy, just learn to cook and bake on coals and make delicious snacks.

The remoteness of your village makes it an ideal location for growing and trading coca. The cartel show up when you’re a child and you’re convinced that they are the only people in the world who know about your home in the mountains; as a teenager, you realize that you’re right. Not even God visits your village. How else could you explain the unspeakable acts of cruelty that happen in your backyard? <br><br>You join the cartel, becoming the monster you always feared. The income is too sweet to make you feel for the people you’ve tortured: coca has made your body and soul numb. <br><br>You’re patrolling the area as you’ve done a thousand times when you suddenly spot a tall white man casually strolling through your coca operation. You get closer and you see that he’s dressed in a ridiculous hat and backpack. How in the world did he get here? Who is this and what does he want?<br><br>You approach him: in the middle of a coca field in the mountains, he greets you with a handshake and a cheery smile like he’s at a fucking dinner party. He has no idea where he is or who you are, but his demeanor says he’s exactly where he should be. In broken Spanglish, he asks you for directions to a building - an empty, crumbling old church abandoned by the Lord himself, long since desecrated by the atrocities under its roof. <br><br>This strange man - the first non-mafioso to visit your village in years - has traveled all the way from London just to see four fucking walls and a roof in your miserable little village. He is so hilariously naive, so unfathomably stupid for unwittingly stumbling across cartel property, that you can’t help but feel he’s harmless. Does he even know how much danger he’s in?

Owing to a peculiar optical illusion, the sun here appears to rise in the West, not the East. If the women were not aware of this peculiarity, they would be pulled in the wrong direction, away from town, further into the jungle. This alone is a powerful, potentially tragic story element.&quot; A Boquete native called Patrick also wrote in this respect: &quot;It&#039;s possible that the girls got disoriented somewhere on the trail and without a compass weren&#039;t able to establish the direction that they started from. If they followed common logic and thought that the Sun sets in the West and headed in that direction then they would actually be heading East. towards Boca del Toro. I know it seems strange to someone not living here but because Panama runs East to West and not North to South this strange illusion takes place. I often watch the Sun rise in the West (South Sea - Pacific) and set behind Volcan Baru (Boca del Toro) in the East.
