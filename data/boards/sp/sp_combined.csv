All the hard work you put into your beautiful little franchise - wearing the jerseys, buying those meaningless shares, making sure to support LGBT causes to keep Aaron happy, watching them ride those stupid little bikes &quot;because it&#039;s tradition!&quot;<br><br>All of it has one simple result: the team is a bigger national target for the men that will eventually fuck them in every phase. Raised the perfect Packers player? Great. Who benefits? If you&#039;re lucky, a random 49er who had nothing to do with the way they grew up, who embarasses them on the football field. He gets to fuck them every January. He gets the benefits of ruining their built up media image and arrogant demeanor that came from the way YOU supported them. As a man who is a Packers fan, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 50 years of your life simply to raise players for another man to physically and mentally destroy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck.<br><br>Think about it logically.",pipe,.jpg,340.0,419.0,101.0,124.0,1613008821275.0,1613008821,NHszm0n4KVcDohYKuF5IAA==,30162.0,105995110,NZ,,,,New Zealand,,,,,105995110,,!!J4xI2YSnzG+,,,,sp

He knows all his weaknesses. He knows all his tendencies. He has seen not only every game, he has seen every practice and every relaxed moment. And he has just been given the motivation of a lifetime now that everyone is discounting his accomplishments at being the product of Brady.<br><br>This is the man who stopped the Greatest Show on Turf and the K-gun offense at their peaks. This is the man who designed (along with Nick Saban) the pattern-read defense which both NE and Alabama have used to terrorize and shut down some of the top offenses in history.

Honestly we&#039;ll never see what Brady could do in a situation like Matthew Stafford was in. Could Brady singlehandedly drag the Lions to playoffs or superbowls for years on end? Or could he have won those NFCCGs with shit tier Packers defenses in 14/16 the way Rodgers couldnt? He succeeds when he&#039;s surrounded by greatness playing at an elite level, which for him has been his entire career, but most starting QBs get a single season like that at most. Imo Manning/Brees/Rodgers or even Kurt Fucking Warner would have 3+ rings from that Pats franchise.

I&#039;m not sure if the players themselves as people/personalities have necessarily changed all that much since then.

If you take someone that&#039;s trained in many different fighting styles and put them up against someone that knows a single one, given that they&#039;re relatively the same skill level level the fighter with more knowledge will almost always win. Even guys that are significantly smaller can neutralize the difference when they put the person on the ground.<br><br>Boxing is just one of the martial arts, whereas MMA is many, combined so the MMA fighter has a huge advantage. <br><br>Even though Tyson is way bigger, if he&#039;s taken to the ground he&#039;ll probably have a hard time defending himself.

That means in earlier primate forms, then yea it doesnt make sense for them to strike, let alone go for a submission because even if they grapple a lot they would be so fast-twitch they could explode out of most positions. However even if a lion&#039;s natural instinct is to bite, as like a chimp, that can still be abaused with our intelligence (look how african warriors will go out in the desert and stick their arm in a lions mouth or maybe choke out lions to then kill it). The complexity of the brain and instincts however is probably much more abstract and difficult to shape through evolution, in the sense that its better to learn how to use one&#039;s body efficiently, and biting is not the answer to a trained fighter 4/5 times.",,,,,,,,1613014208,,,105956129,US,,,,United States,,,,,105956129,,,,,,sp

Canada is currently the country outside the USA with the most NBA players by quite some distance, we are literally the only country outside the USA who has the depth to put together three lines and have them all be NBA players. The reason we are ranked so poorly is because most of our best players dont show up for the national team. The last FIBA world cup took place just a couple weeks before the start of the NBA season so everyone opted out and we played with our C team. The same thing happened to the states but they are so dominate in the sport they can send a competitive team no matter what whereas we cant.

Braasch was described by one journalist as &quot;a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple of bottles of ice cold lager&quot;. The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park,[58] after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5–0, beat her 6–1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6–2.[56] Braasch said afterwards, &quot;500 and above, no chance&quot;. He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game &quot;fun&quot; and that the big difference was that men can chase down shots much easier and put spin on the ball that female players can&#039;t handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.</span>",7ef,.jpg,1237.0,1600.0,96.0,125.0,1613008132811.0,1613008132,BxB+H2PFGkoKmSoFcNVDmg==,164986.0,105994007,US,,,,United States,,,,,105994007,,,,,,sp

To my mind (and again I am no expert) the starting 11 if england played right now should be the following <br><br>Pickford <br>James <br>Stones <br>Maguire <br>Shaw <br>Rice <br>Henderson <br>Mount <br>Rashford <br>Kane <br>Sancho <br><br>-Pickford is the only English keeper that is used to playing in a team that doesn’t just play a low block and force shots from distance (Henderson now plays in this system but not enough). Pope and Heaton look good because they make lots of saves every game. I know Pickford makes howlers but he fits the system. <br><br>-Stones covers Maguire’s pace issues. Maguire is the natural leader in the back 4 and whilst every pisses on him he is a good organiser. Shaw has an understanding with Maguire and is also excellent going forward and defending (this season at least). James provides a more attacking right side to link with Sancho. <br><br>- Rice is a great screen for the defence and he also always looks to play the ball forward once he wins possession. Henderson provides huge energy in midfield and also motivates those around him to be better. Mount is technically sound and also comes up with plenty of goals and assists. He is also happy to track back when needed. <br><br>-Sancho provides a real threat with width and quality on the ball. Kane and Rashford (Rashford to play Son’s role) try to link with eachother Past the last line of defence.",,,,,,,,1612768444,,,105929047,GB,,,,United Kingdom,,,,,105929047,,,,,,sp

Other than France, the three examples you use all have players playing in their own leagues and, by coincidence, those same two all have players playing for the same domestic team.<br>I&#039;m not sure if I can explain it the way I want to, but it&#039;s sort of an economics based thing. The Premier League is the best league in the world because it buys the best players it can from everywhere it can. Other countries, likely because of finances, develop their own.<br>Therefore we&#039;ll buy players from Spain, from Germany, from France etc, but they don&#039;t buy ours. Rather than developing our own players we &quot;pay clubs&quot; to develop players and then buy them from them once they&#039;re developed. The only exception being younger players who we buy from abroad and develop based on their potential.<br>So while French youth players are competing against other French youth players for starts in their domestic sides, Spanish against Spanish etc, English players are competing against youth players from all over the world for starts in their domestic sides and more often than not the foreign bought player is kept on because of the outlay and because they&#039;ve been identified as having higher potential while the English player is released.<br>While a French club might have someone with potential bought by a club like Chelsea, an English player with potential drops down the divisions (like Vardy for example) because foreign clubs don&#039;t buy them.<br>It&#039;s why we have strong domestic teams, but foreign countries have strong NTs. You can&#039;t really have both unless you balance it correctly.<br>It&#039;s similar economics with &quot;overpriced&quot; British players. It&#039;s not that their prices are inflated entirely because they&#039;re British. It&#039;s because they qualify as HG which you need X amount of in your squad. But because fewer are developed the best ones come at a higher premium.",Maybe this explains it better than I can,.jpg,620.0,695.0,111.0,125.0,1612771488351.0,1612771488,HshQB/1JsQ2PpAZJEiC59g==,41215.0,105929047,GB,,,,United Kingdom,,,,,105929047,,,,,,sp

That run of 1 win from 10 before Christmas is in large part on him and his tactical failings. He had plenty of creative mids that he could integrate into the first team at the start of the season (Ozil, Mkhi, ESR) and yet he insisted on this weird system that had no creative mids and no dynamism in central midfield. Instead we had this weird focus on wideplay for a team with unremarkable wide players and aerially weak forwards. We were close to the relegation zone by the time he decided to change things (with the introduction of ESR). And while things are better structurally since then, his choices have left us with a mid-table midfield (ESR + Odegaard don&#039;t get into Leicester or Villa&#039;s midfield for example).

The way he&#039;s been treated will have left a bitter taste in his mouth. There were other big clubs interested in him - they will have undoubtedly spoken to his agent about their plans for him. But he chose Arsenal and they made a really big financial commitment in him. That signing was a big statement about Arsenal&#039;s belief in his talent. He had every reason to believe this was going to be a big step up in his career. <br><br>Instead, he gets here, Arteta treats him like some third-rate youth prospect, he spends six months languishing in the reserves, and even if his loan is going well right now his career has been left entirely up in the air. He can&#039;t see what&#039;s going to happen to him six months from now. The career progression he had planned has been completely thrown into limbo. It&#039;s clear he regrets coming to Arsenal and if you&#039;re a youth player from overseas you&#039;ll be looking at him as an example of how poorly Arsenal can manage your development.",,,,,,,,1612838787,,,105933260,GB,,,,United Kingdom,,,,,105933260,,,,,,sp

Let me break it down for you: Statbabbies conveniently ignore that there&#039;s one QB stat to rule them all - Rings. Brady has 7. That&#039;s like 3 more than any other QB. Maybe if meme QBs like Brees or Rodgers wanted to be taken more seriously, they would concentrate less on gay sex and saluting the flag, and more time on boosting their ring count. Put together, they only have 2. That means that Tom Brady is 3.5x better than Brees and Rodgers combined. What&#039;s more, those 2 frauds have been carried every step of the way, while Brady has had to lift shitty teams to victory in the murderer&#039;s row AFC East which usually sends a minimum of 2 teams to the playoffs each year.

Then you add bookies to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down.

I was inspired and only took them to win, and as i was watching live, passing with the heel, will the other guys were defending strongly. Then 2nd half corner kick, header goal. 0-1 i knew it&#039;s done. -100<br><br>For PSG should be the best game of the night, most money, derby. So <br>100 @1.50 away win .

So even thou that didn&#039;t hit, it was a tremendous bet, and correctly played. <br>So total stakes for PSG : 360<br>Won 150+50.<br>Result:-160<br><br><br>But it was a Red card eventually, but it should have been a penalty at Neymar Alvaro. So could have hit penalty and Red card, which would be another +100, and 3 goals should have hit, another +50 on pregame, and +100 on live, and maybe one more to make it 4 and all of sudden you&#039;re drowning in profit . While taking your money back progresively. But the ref decided not to award a penalty when he should have given, the same ref who in cfr-young boys gave a penalty when he shouldn&#039;t given .

He should have awarded a penalty on Neymar. Goddamn these guys are afraid of PSG. like the ref was shitting his pants so much. It was 0-2 min 90 and it&#039;s a foul, a marseille player, Alvaro ,is sitting like a bitch on the ground from the min 87 sth, so very long, like 3 or 4 minutes. And it&#039;s 90:00 and it shows 4+ minutes extra time. And seconds pass, it&#039;s 91:00 sth until they put the ball back into play. PSG still trying to attack. I&#039;m looking at the ref min 93:40 he&#039;s checking his watch, then 93:57 already blows the whistle, like he wanted out, he wanted to finish this, and go home, no drama, no problems, just straight obedient asshole. Whatever, so if that idiot says it&#039;s not a penalty, thus not the 3rd goal, means the bet wasn&#039;t top class? It was a special too. Maybe next time it wins. I&#039;m marking it a (moral) win.<br><br>Chelsea.

Answer: straight win.<br><br>Cause i only took 2 goals cause once it ends 2-2, but usually underdogs don&#039;t score 2 goals. So 1-0 wins likelier than 2-2 draws. And straight win include 2-0, 2-1 wins also. <br><br>So take a straight win<br>And then 3 goals<br>And 4 <br><br>So in this case, because Chelsea only won 1-2, i only got the money back.

Then the live bet on CFR to score, to reduce damage, seems like going in like 5 times, still everything saved by the keeper or sth. Still a good bet that again doesn&#039;t hit.<br><br>So if anybody tailed these tips, I&#039;m sorry you lost, but i have no apologies cause they were good bets. For instance, norway was reporting the same shit i was seeing.<br><br>And now TT lost his bankroll too. 1 goal until 60th min, so the 2nd for the first half, + 15 more minutes. And still didn&#039;t land, and it should have been a winner. Meme cup or whatever, they created chances at will, and could have scored the 3rd goal, or more...<br><br>It&#039;s not wishful thinking for overs, it&#039;s just recognizing the games with lots of scoring chances. Only everything that could go wrong, went wrong.

In the past, the ref wouldn&#039;t waved it on as &quot;didn&#039;t look purposeful&quot; but now they feel obliged to assume intent because, if they don&#039;t, fans will get buttmad that &quot;it did touch the arm though!!!&quot;",,,,,,,,1612802653,,,105937806,GB,,,,United Kingdom,,,,,105937806,,,,,,sp

We are quite poor defensively in general, so shoring us up with 3ATB might be the right move.

And let&#039;s not compare Brady&#039;s SB performances with that of his supposed predecessor, Joe Montana. The disparity between their passer ratings is frankly embarrassing. And it&#039;s embarrassing for the whole sport. Because the purported &quot;GOAT&#039;s&quot; of the other leagues don&#039;t unravel under the microscope. It&#039;s simply impossible to contend that Babe Ruth, Wayne Gretzky, and Michael Jordan weren&#039;t astronomically better than their peers. They revolutionized their respective games to such a degree, they made a mockery of the very notion of competition. Whereas Brady doesn&#039;t survive statistical scrutiny, and he doesn&#039;t pass the eye-test.<br><br>And you know what the worst part is? In a few of those throws last night, I saw in Mahomes something I haven&#039;t seen in a long time: a blinding spark of athletic brilliance. It was genuinely reminiscent of watching Jordan pirouette through a whole team before launching himself into the air. Leaving you with the sense that you&#039;d just witnessed something impossible. Granted, football is a much different sport, with a much different structure. But that sort of surreal shit is the whole reason I watch.

Tom has never been the driving force in any of his super bowls other than 28-3. He is a good qb and top 10 for sure but what he is good at is being a coach on excellent teams. All his wins he was surrounded by elite talent and again what made him win his owls was the ability to mold a team around his weaknesses. He doesn&#039;t have a good day throwing? His defense is STOUT. He&#039;s getting blitzed out of his mind? Oh well establish the run. He can&#039;t throw bombs? Nickel and dime down the field. Defense starts defending the short field start going long. He isn&#039;t the GOAT but he is the smartest and now the nfl is becoming like the NBA. Who we should really hate is players like Antonio brown who weasel their way off teams and out of contracts to keep helping him. He is THE system qb and is the best at manipulation.,sketch-1595625424340,.png,1536.0,1440.0,250.0,234.0,1613002239570.0,1613002239,jlwY5SQgA1Q/JZ0HhmPjTg==,2032592.0,0,US,0.0,0.0,tom-brady-isnt-the-goat-qb,United States,1.0,0.0,1.0,,105992916,,,,,,sp

Pair this with talking about defenses with Bill Belichick for almost 20 years, and you probably know more than virtually all offensive coordinators or coaches in the league about dissecting the game. He&#039;s able to make in-game defensive reads and adjustments that basically no other quarterback can today. The closest comparison would be someone like Peyton Manning at the end of his career, who for all intents and purposes was the OC of the Broncos, but Peyton&#039;s body was so destroyed by the end that he could barely throw a football. Tom is still elite. <br><br>The second is that his halo effect is unreal, and that&#039;s something that only has snowballed over the years. His ability to brainwash players and get them to buy into whatever he is doing is unparalleled. He&#039;s no joke like a cult leader. The guy is universally loved by everyone he plays with: murderers, rapists, psychos, whatever. Look at guys like Antonio Brown, compltely out of control and essentially blacklisted from the NFL.

Obviously, physical ability and skills are important and frankly they&#039;re a necessary prerequisite to even get to the point where you can utilize that anticipatory skill. You can&#039;t be an NBA player if you&#039;re five foot, three inches, for example. You have to reach a certain baseline. But once you have reached that minimum mandatory baseline of athletic ability, and you have an extraordinary advantage in technical skills and anticipatory instincts and knowledge, you can compensate for a huge deficiency in athletics talent. Obviously some sorts and positions depend more on athleticism than others. But even in those sports, this principle still remains true. It&#039;s incredible that most fans and even scouts, general managers and coaches still fail to understand this. <br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csg<wbr>nGyabJf8",,,,,,,,1612914978,,,105963384,US,,,,United States,,,,,105963384,,,,,,sp

If you have only cups, a lot of teams would be eliminated before the end, and supporters would be left unentertained. It used to be like this before, so clubs and federations had to make up for this with soulless friendlies and meme tournaments for teams which nothing left to compete for.<br>Pontos corridos solve this issue because all teams have matches throughout the full season. It&#039;s better than friendlies/meme tournaments because every team has something to fight for in pontos corridos. The best fight for the title and copalib spots; the mid table fight for sudakino spots; the shitters fight against relegation. Yes, sometimes a team wins the trophy before the end, but we still have teams fighting for copalib/sudakino/relegation until the end.<br>And even if you think brasileirão has no emotion, we still have cdb, copalib and sudakino.

It&#039;ll be Torque or Peñarol. <br><br>Peñarol isn&#039;t taking Libertadores for 2 reasons:<br><br>1. Because it knows it isn&#039;t ready for it - if they don&#039;t get the spot, then it was better they didn&#039;t, because it&#039;s a squad in dire needs of rebuild. <br><br>2. They have the chips on fighting the championship, which is important symbolically as it has the name of one of the most beloved players. Adding a match to the schedule won&#039;t help, and this is a heavily injury-prone squad. The only actual playmaker there is is already out. So, instead of rushing an extra match they aren&#039;t even confident on winning, they rather keep building up and see what they get. <br><br>I&#039;m actually a Peñarol supporter and would rather see them go to Sudamericana. It&#039;s the Libertadores that destroyed us: we know we can&#039;t realistically fight for it but incur in debt and bad decisions doing so. Plus we&#039;ve got a new manager and it&#039;s better for him to build without pressure for a full year, and Sudamericana will be a proper fit to us. We&#039;re not Libertadores material.<br><br>Plus, Peñarol has the grande meme power, Rentistas is in torrid form. Nacional is too. The championship is going to Torque or Peñarol, and whoever it is, they&#039;re battering Rentistas. Watch it. In other news, as you show in <a href=""#p105954088"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;105954088</a> the system is absolutely retarded.
