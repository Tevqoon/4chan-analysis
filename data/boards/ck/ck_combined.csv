It became a site for people to discuss various hobbies that they like, and due to its origin that meant mostly anime enjoyers. Its expected to see some 2d cuties anywhere on the site so people shouldn&#039;t be rustled by it, but on the other hand it doesn&#039;t mean weebs should plaster cartoons on all their ops. It reminds me of one time on /k/ someone decided to make an &quot;gun girl&quot; thread, where they didnt talk about guns at all but just dumped anime pics of girls in uniforms holding guns. Dumping drawn images of girls is not gonna go well on the board where autists want to talk about guns and gun accessories. <br>Maybe dont post a mundane question and an anime picture next time.

Here is my journal for the 2020 Autumn Qianjiazhai gu hua sheng pu&#039;er from Verdant Tea:<br><br>Dry leaf smells of smoked sugar, somewhat green. Maybe faintly woodsy. Might be imagining it, but there is almost a hint of liquorice. Aromas aren&#039;t extremely potent, but noticeable and not unpleasant.<br><br><br>Stewed carrot smell, some pleasantly sour herbaceous funk scent. For first infusion, flavor is muted and light. May need to brew longer. <br><br>Interesting second infusion. The bitterness and sourness both settled down instead of increased. Low astringency, low to medium thickness. There is a slight herb retronasal flavor present that works well with the low bitterness. If I whip up air in my mouth after swallowing, it almost reminds me of matcha, but with less potential of sweetness. <br><br>Not getting too much forward flavor, but the body sensation is nice. It is modest and not at all intense, nor flat. Medium yellow color. I wouldn&#039;t say this is an excellent tea, but I find the subtle herb/bitter profile to be rather relaxing and gentle. I like the herb flavor/scent profile shift over time compared to the initial stewed vegetal impression. Feels somewhat nice after drinking a few infusions. <br><br>I think this is a tea that lends itself to slightly lower temperatures to round out the bitterness and bring out the herbaceousness. Water quality may also be more apparent with this leaf than with some others. <br><br>This isn&#039;t a poor tea in my opinion, though anyone looking for sweet or floral notes might be disappointed. If you like herb and mild bitter notes, and desire something understated and gentle, it&#039;s not too bad of a choice. This is a tea for when you feel dreadful, but don&#039;t want any sweet or excessively indulgent flavors blasted at you.",20210209_193942,.jpg,4032.0,1908.0,125.0,59.0,1612929677809.0,1612929677,Jlcbvn6ttHAWOoXLTDwe0A==,1950753.0,15554594,,,,,,,15554594,,,,,,,ck

But she rarely did.<br><br>We&#039;d get into screaming arguments constantly about how lazy and worthless she was. I felt like an asshole for it, but goddamn she was a real piece of work. The only reason I dealt with all this was for the kids, and also because the sex is great.<br><br>But one night, I got fed up. Not only did she get drunk, neglect the kids, and made me top Ramen for dinner, but she decided to give me attitude too. She was being real fucking bitchy. So I told my grandparents to keep an eye on the kids and told my wife we were going to go out and have dinner together. I drove maybe 3 blocks to a quiet area (we live in Oregon, it&#039;s not hard to find a quiet field) and I got out of the car, went around like I was going to open her door for her and let her out, and I just beat the shit out of her while she was still seatbelted. After a few punches, I asked her if she wanted to go back to her parents. She started screaming and yelling and said yes, so I beat the shit out of her again. Then I asked her what she wanted to do. She finally got smart and said she wanted to go home. So I took her home and dared her to start trouble. I even handed her my cellphone and dialed her mom&#039;s number on the drive home. I made her talk to her mom, while daring her to fucking say something.<br><br>Before that incident, I had never laid a hand on her. But I had always threatened it. I told her &quot;one of these days, if you don&#039;t straighten up, I&#039;m going to lay hands on you.&quot;<br><br>All my meals have been on time, and she just recently tried to make a meatloaf.

You should use a standard wide glass cup and press down on the bread with the rim to make the cutouts, so the remaining bread is really just a rim with squared ends to contain the egg symmetrically and make it easier to flip. Meanwhile you toast the center piece which is over half the surface area of the original slice of bread, then butter it lightly and use it to dip in the yolk. Excess yolk can be spread over the border bread.<br>Conversely, half cook the yolk so just the center of it is wet and spread the wet part and mushy sides over the border, and put peanut butter and jelly on the center toast instead.",,,,,,,,1612881519,,,15552190,,,,,,,15552190,,,,,,,ck

Some would consider drying to be important, but I drip dry on a day to day basis. If guests are coming over, I’ll generally just run everything (already clean) through the dishwasher just so nothing has any water mineral spots.

As you&#039;re doing this smell touch and taste every single thing you add to a dish. The smell thing is very important because if you do this you will learn how to tell when stuff is done or what ingredients you need to add just off its smell alone.

Having recently gone through a pretty painful bout (they had to give me fentanyl in the hospital), I&#039;d urge you to cut back.

I said, &quot;Wow, three for free!&quot; and the nice friendly McDonald&#039;s™ worker laughed and said, &quot;I&#039;m going to call you 3-for-free!&quot;. Now the staff greets me with &quot;hey it&#039;s 3-for-free!&quot; and ALWAYS give me three packets.

The difference is that with Service à la française, all dishes in each course would be set in a pre-determined pattern on the table at the same time. The hosts and guests would then serve each other based on what was nearby--this included not only portioning out food but carving up the meats, with staff on hand in case you wanted something that was at the opposite end of the table. Whole meats would typically be set at the head of the table as the host would be prepared to carve them.<br><br>With Service à la russe, the meal was broken up into far more courses/services--so instead of all the dishes which would have, under the French style, been part of a single course set on the table, only each specific dish would be served at once. This is why you started seeing meals with many many courses, because rather than the first course being all savory dishes (soup, vegetables, fish); it would be soup only, then second course was vegetables, then third course was fish, etc. The only dishes set on the table would be additions that people could choose to add more of to their food, such as a sauce; dessert was sometimes used as the centerpiece, along with flowers and decorations.

But NO Ham can be found in the food item known as the &quot;Ham&quot; Burger. The issue is further worsened by the use of cheese within such food items, creating what is known as a &quot;Cheese&quot; Burger. Note that here the word has been fully split into two words, &quot;Cheese&quot; in place of the original &quot;Ham&quot; and &quot;Burger&quot; representing the overall food item. Its clear by this construction that the food item being described is to be known as a &quot;Burger&quot; and the preceding word is describing the prime ingredient of note. Without and additional toppings, this would be expected to be simply the beef patty which is within the Burger, but instead of calling such a plain form of Burger a Beefburger, we all collectively agree to ignore this affront to basic lingual logic and use the pants on head retarded term of &quot;Hamburger.&quot;<br><br>Fucks sake",,,,,,,,1612994522,,,15561545,,,,,,,15561545,,,,,,,ck

Like at least once a week.<br>My go to is McD because of the fries. Wendy&#039;s and BK fries are kind of meh. McD fries are GOAT.<br>Plain cheeseburger to plain cheeseburger? BK is best tasting, Wendy&#039;s, then McD.<br>Specialty burgers go Baconator, then Bacon King, then Double 1/4lb with chz and bacon. Wendy&#039;s nails the sauce on the Baconator.<br>Having said all of that, I am pressed when deciding who to order from because of McD&#039;s fries. BK does have frozen Coke and jalapeno poppers, which are good. Wendy&#039;s has the spicy chicken nuggers for cheap, but they&#039;re not quite as cheap as McD&#039;s nuggers. And really, by the time I get to them, I&#039;m kind of stuffed anyways and end up trying to force them down cold. McD has cheap drinks though, I think it&#039;s just a dollar for a large drink. It&#039;s nice to bulk up on drinks for that price. It helps to get the food down your throat.<br>An ideal meal for me would be a Baconator with 2 large fries from McD, 2 orders jalapeno poppers from BK, and 2 cheap cheeseburgers from BK as a back-up. Frozen Coke from BK and a large orange Fanta from McD. Small soft serve with chocolate from BK or McD for dessert.",,,,,,,,1612941504,,,15557914,,,,,,,15557914,,,,,,,ck

I can tell you my favorite burgers from each I&#039;ve had regularly though.<br><br>From McDonalds, I have always enjoyed their Double Cheeseburger, yes the Double Cheese, not the McDouble, I am old enough to remember when the controversial switch happened and I do think the second slice of McCheese makes for a better burger. Two Double Cheeseburgers is my go to choice.<br><br>At Burger King, I enjoy the Whopper and Whopper Jr., I find the no cheese but smokey flavored patty works very well with the salad combination and whatever brand of ketchup and mayo they use, it all works together to create a satisfying &quot;Whopper juice&quot; as it were, that is best sopped up with some fries off the plate.<br><br>For Wendy&#039;s, the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger has been my classic go to. Bacon lettuce and tomato, with the mayo? A classic combination that works just as well on a burger.<br><br>At White Castle, classically my order was always Two Double Bacon Sliders, and Two Double Jalapeno Cheese Sliders, their Doubles are a tripple decker mini burger in which the mid tier bun does a great job of bringing you some more sopping wet steamy onion juice sponge goodness, and while it seems they&#039;ve phased out their &quot;Jalapeno Cheese&quot; in recent times, it was a great Pepper Jack type cheese.<br><br>At Checkers/Rallys, I go for the Big Buford, it is a big one and much like the Whopper it has all of the salad, but they use shredded lettuce which I feel works great on burgers and sweet RED onions instead of the typical white, this is a unique choice and one I thoroughly approve of. It also differs from the Whopper in that they add mustard to the ketchup and mayo combination, almost a statement to say &quot;this burger goes ALL the way&quot;, as well as two pieces of cheese one per patty, it&#039;s truly a big burger and it does satisfy.",,,,,,,,1612943812,,,15557914,,,,,,,15557914,,,,,,,ck

I think Checkers/Rallys has the best fries most certainly, though closely followed by McDonalds fries. White Castle serves crinkle cut fries which are kind of novel so I&#039;ll give them third place, they satisfy a certain cafeteria craving other fries don&#039;t. Then, I guess I&#039;ll say Wendy&#039;s fries are better than BK, they have the charm of featuring some potato skin which is a bit novel whilst not being a totally impressive fry, while BK comes in last place with simply a somewhat sorry fry that becomes kind of bad the less hot it becomes, which by BK standards usually isn&#039;t that hot to begin with.<br><br>For Chicken, I say McDonalds does it best simply because of their McNuggets, which are the only crisp/crunchy fast food nugget, the rest are more crumby/crumbly. Followed by Wendy&#039;s, then Checkers, then White Castle, than BK.",,,,,,,,1612944075,,,15557914,,,,,,,15557914,,,,,,,ck

Any more than that might skirt the law, but Hanson says it&#039;s likely not all that harmful. &quot;You&#039;d have to eat an awful lot of cheese for the cellulose to affect you. Most consumers don&#039;t know but there&#039;s actually cellulose in all kinds of foods — cereals, for instance.

When I moved out, I started using a hand masher. It did a great job, but sometimes if I was in a hurry or wasn&#039;t very thorough, there could be lumps in it.<br><br>A couple of months ago I picked up a ricer, and holy shit. It changes the game. I still use a hand-masher for when I leave the skins on, but if I want a really fluffy mash or if I&#039;m making a topping for a cottage pie, the ricer is such an incredible tool. It comes out super fluffy and all you need to use to stir in your butter, milk, and seasoning is a spoon. I&#039;ve also heard you can use them to make cauliflower or carrot mash, as well as use a large setting to make spatzle. <br><br>Also, parboiled baby (new) potatoes that are lightly smashed until the skins pop (but the filling doesn&#039;t come oozing out), that are then baked or fried are amazing.

Just because you can live to 60 on a diet, doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s something we should all choose.<br><br>We know where the populations with the highest longevity and lowest age-related diseases ate. It was more than just the turn of the century Okinawan diet, there have been meta-studies that include millions of participating individuals. The traits they share are these: the diet is typically very high in vegetables and fruits, gets 45-55% of their calories from carbohydrates such as tubers, grains, and beans, ate meat and poultry and fish sparingly, and avoided highly processed foods and added sugars. So when you have the choice between potatoes and a potato chip, choose potatoes. Between rice and wheat or breads and pastas made from their flours, you lean toward the whole grains. Sugar from fruit is fine (they&#039;ve literally tested 10-15 servings of fruit per day on top of a traditionally healthy diet with no excess weight gain or change in biomarkers), it&#039;s added sugar from HCFS and the like that&#039;s the deal breaker.
