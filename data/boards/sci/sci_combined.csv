We transitioned to a more science rather than technical based curriculum for engineering students about that time. This left industry in a predicament as companies like US Steel for example traditionally hired recent grads into positions involving operations on the shop floor (and saved the work that you consider engineering for the more experienced engineers), and the new theory based grads were unfamiliar with handling such tasks. This created problems so the old curriculum was revived under the name engineering technology. Because of the cold war and the space race there were lots of research grants available for schools that focused on scientific and advanced technical research, so many of the large engineering colleges lost interest in having a &quot;two track program&quot; and moved to divest themselves of their ET programs focusing instead on research. The ET programs were allowed to go to smaller less prestigious schools unless there was a major local industry interest in keeping them. School politics also played a role in things as well. In many states, like GA, you have one main engineering school jealously guarding its monopoly for many years, leaving the other smaller schools with the choice of either (starting in the 60&#039;s) adding engineering technology or remaining just liberal arts schools. Considering that the majority of the schools finding themselves in this situation, and shut out of developing their own engineering curriculum, are primarily either HBCUs, or otherwise catering to 1/2",,,,,,,,1612744738,,,12673547,,,,,,12673547,,,,,,sci

Turns out that the Chinese government sends students to the US for grad school and they enroll in whatever program will take them. Most grad schools trust their students to figure out what course to take on their own with advisers available but not required each term. So the Chinese grad students enrolled in Textile Management or Agricultural Research pack into CS classes. For them the CS degree means they can live in a big city like Shanghai instead of rural China where all the textile and farms are located. But many of them have zero CS knowledge. I had two Chinese girls ask me what was the difference between a Bit and a Byte. This was in a graduate level algorithms class.<br>It&#039;s a messed up system but as long as they satisfy all of the requirements for a CS graduate degree, neither the university nor the Chinese government care what grad program they enrolled in. And even if there was a requirement to have their course schedule approved by an advisor, every university has tons a Chinese faculty who are more than happy to serve as an advisor to Chinese students. This happens with Indian students too, but more commonly takes the form of zero work independent study courses for which they get an automatic A.<br>Since the Chinese students are paying full out-of-state rates, the universities are making money off of them and really don&#039;t care about the particulars of what&#039;s going on at the student and classroom level.",ok chang,.webm,480.0,640.0,93.0,125.0,1612809610301.0,1612809610,RcKSahAtYwFIFH+vmxunFA==,1344441.0,12673547,,,,,,12673547,,,,,,sci

The good news when it comes to machine learning is that there is a huge open source community all over the internet, so you can find great and extensive resources as a beginner. When in doubt, start with youtube.<br><br>I started with the free courses that exist in freecodecamp, and after I completed their projects for the certification, I went on to places like Jovian and Kaggle where they offer other free resources (project ideas, data and GPUs). <br>I also got a Coursera Professional Certificate (paid), but other than being fancier than the others, I can&#039;t say it was worth it from an educational standpoint. The assignments were totally half-assed and it didn&#039;t feel rewarding. But I have to say, IBMs Coursera course on PyTorch was by far the best explanation on Deep Learning I&#039;ve ever had.<br>The key part I think is finding the right balance between learning the theory and implementing it. I know many uni courses focus too much on the theoretical aspects of ML and don&#039;t offer any applications to practice. On the other hand, if you dive straight into Kaggle competitions you&#039;ll end up just copy pasting code without understanding what&#039;s going on.<br> <br>That sums up how I&#039;ve managed to get experience without doing uni courses. I&#039;m now trying to write up a few tidy projects and put them up on github so I can show when applying for jobs. <br>If you are looking for motivation, I&#039;m not sure what to tell you. I&#039;ve been suffering from lack of motivation for almost everything I&#039;ve ever studied, but since getting into ML I genuinely enjoy doing it, regardless the subject. <br>I have to admit I don&#039;t know if this will pay off in the end.

The Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx), launched by Harvard University scientists, aims to examine this solution by spraying non-toxic calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dust into the atmosphere — a sun-reflecting aerosol that may offset the effects of global warming (https://www.reuters.com/article/cl<wbr>imate-change-geoengineering-idUSL8N<wbr>2IY3SM).</span><br><br>Widespread research into the efficacy of solar geoengineering has been stalled for years due to controversy. Opponents believe such science comes with unpredictable risks, including extreme shifts in weather patterns not dissimilar to warming trends we are already witnessing. Environmentalists similarly fear that a dramatic shift in mitigation strategy will be treated as a green light to continue emitting greenhouse gases with little to no changes in current consumption and production patterns.<br><br>SCoPEx will take a small step in its early research this June near the town of Kiruna, Sweden, where the Swedish Space Corporation has agreed to help launch a balloon carrying scientific equipment 12 miles (20 km) high. The launch will not release any stratospheric aerosols. Rather, it will serve as a test to maneuver the balloon and examine communications and operational systems. If successful, this could be a step towards a second experimental stage that would release a small amount of CaCO3 dust into the atmosphere (https://room.eu.com/news/experimen<wbr>t-to-dim-sunlight-with-chalk-dust-u<wbr>nder-review).<br><br>The exact amount of CaCO3 needed to cool the planet is unknown, and SCoPEx scientists similarly cannot confirm whether it is the best stratospheric aerosol for the job.",1581862436461,.jpg,704.0,697.0,250.0,247.0,1612788613394.0,1612788613,5Y1khkaclom46RMDUTkfyg==,33754.0,0,,a-bill-gates-venture-aims-to-spray-dust-into-the,92.0,18.0,63.0,12681426,A Bill Gates venture aims to spray dust into the atmosphere to block the sun,0.0,0.0,,,sci

You don&#039;t need to put that much crap in the atmosphere to have a large effect. At least that&#039;s what we think. They want to release a plume of material and see how it spreads out as it gets further from the balloon. While this seems sort of dumb, we don&#039;t understand fluids all that well at very high reynolds numbers. They also want to see how the aerosol scatters light and monitor any changes to atmospheric chemistry. I&#039;m saying all this because I went to this dude&#039;s talk.

The appliance works fine when fed lower power, since the standard in the US is smaller than in the EU. However once the wattage exceeds a certain threshold, it&#039;s possible for components to start failing. To make it so that the failure will always occur in the same place to make repairs easier &amp; less costly, fuses are included in circuits as an intentional weakpoint. When things get too hot, the fuse literally burns out (the filament inside melts or whatever), breaking the circuit and preventing any more power from flowing into the system to protect the more costly components.",1612616665622,.jpg,1039.0,1576.0,82.0,125.0,1612713761537.0,1612713761,m37+F5CHaNydAstODFLT0Q==,190539.0,12677060,,,,,,12677060,,,,,,sci

Z(G) forms a subgroup of G, hence its order divides G by Lagrange&#039;s Theorem - Z(G) and its cosets form a partition of G. So you&#039;ve got a1 Z(G), a2 Z(G), etc, where each a1 could be chosen from that particular coset (and any element in Z(G), usually e, can be chosen for the trivial coset Z(G) itself).<br>So you can think of it as, just as with Z/5Z, saying &quot;if all the elements that commute in G are &#039;&#039;&#039;equivalent&#039;&#039;&#039; in some sense, then G can be cut into some set of &#039;&#039;&#039;multiples&#039;&#039;&#039; of that set&quot;. That&#039;s not special to Z(G), that just how quotient groups work, but keeping that definition in mind can be helpful - maybe it&#039;s not intuitive (I don&#039;t know if there is an intuitive explanation desu), but at least it can make it seem less strange that a natural object like Z(G) could be used in that way. <br>And, of course, if G is abelian then Z(G) = G -- there&#039;s only the trivial coset -- whereas if G somehow lacks *any* commutating elements other than e, the cosets of Z(G) would be the sets containing every element of G. If more than just e commutes, that in some sense &quot;collapses&quot; the latter trivial partitioning by calling certain objects &#039;equal&#039;.<br>Idk hope that sort of helps",,,,,,,,1612805981,,,12677060,,,,,,12677060,,,,,,sci

However, they have additional further structure:<br>- A field is an integral domain is a ring, meaning it has a (I think necessarily?) commutative multiplication operator that works how you expect in Q or R: every element has a multiplicative inverse.<br>- Vector spaces don&#039;t really usually have a great corresponding &quot;multiplication&quot;. Think in 3D: the inner (dot) product gives a scalar, not a vector; the cross product sort of fits the bill, but it&#039;s not distributive or commutative (ab = -ba) (note: differential calc is beyond me, but I&#039;ve read how the cross product going 3D x 3D --&gt; 3D is actually kind of coincidental in some weird way).<br>- Vector spaces, in general, are a collection of objects satisfying additive properties group properties (vectors), plus an additional set of objects you can use to scale and distribute over the vectors (scalars, hence the name). The scalars specifically have to be a field as defined above - you couldn&#039;t use Z, I think.<br><br>These definitions can give really wide variety of things the vector definition - sets of continuous functions, for instance, can be vector fields, usually using either R or C as the associated scalars.

I&#039;m now trying to create a new environment to contain the abstracts and some other information, and that was going reasonably well but I don&#039;t know how to handle the bibliography now. The only option I could think of is manually entering each reference into a global .bib file and then using keywords to print them below their respective articles.

This is why we have schools, so that they can gamify the learning process by making us care about things like grades etc. It’s not a bad system, it clearly works. But at some point you’re expected to have some fucking agency and be able to LARP your way into learning things on your own. Clearly you’ve implicitly come to the conclusion that whatever you’re trying to learn isn’t of utility of you. If it was, you’d remember it. Part of it is the fact that you’re a NEET that’s spent the last 4 years doing things of little significance every single day that you end up ejected from memory the next day. Now the problem is that you’ve made the conscious decision to actually do something useful with your life and learn something but your mind still remains in the habit of discarding most of the information you acquire during the day. It doesn’t distinguish between Quantum Field Theory and the retarded YouTube videos you consume. So what’s the solution? Keep doing whatever it is you’re trying to learn. Eventually your subconscious will catch up and realise that this thing is of importance to you and retain it. Why in the fuck you expected your brain to instantly retain information after 4 years of giving it no reason to do so, I don’t know. You’ve also chosen to try and learn Physics, so good luck trying to trigger a mechanism that’s evolved to ensure your physical survival by doing Lagrangian Mechanics, it won’t be easy. Maybe learn to code, you’ll be introduced to a lot of mathematics and possibly some physics. The idea of acquiring an employable skill along the way might do the trick. But at the end of the day the point is that you need skin in the game to have any hope of learning something of of even remote difficulty. You’re only option is to stick with it and figure out what the best LARP for getting you to learn is given how you’re wired. Good luck anon.",,,,,,,,1613016717,,,12691776,,,,,,12691776,,,,,,sci

1061,12691390,,,02/10/21(Wed)17:44:16,Zed,"The behavior of pee pee coming out of dickholes is a fascinating subject. To start, the flow is what&#039;s known as &#039;laminar&#039;, which is the hydrodynamic equivalent of the pisswater saying &quot;your dickhole is a god to me&quot;. But the laminar flow isn&#039;t like the neat crystal-clear arching cylinder of perfecty-flowing water that you sometimes get out of a garden hose. That&#039;s because a dickhole isn&#039;t round, like a garden hose, but rather an ellipse of high eccentricity, like the orbits of many long-period comets. In fact, if you were to shrink the orbit of comet C/1882 R1, also known as the Great Comet of 1882, down to the size of a dickhole, you would see that the two shapes are nearly identical. <br><br>What this means for the pee pee coming out of the dickhole is that there is less room for the pisswater to come out at the perigee and apogee of the dickhole than in the middle. This results in a region of higher pressure in the pee pee stream, and, as our old friend Daniel Bernoulli taught us long ago, if the pressure of a fluid flow increases, the speed of the flow must therefore decrease. This difference in fluid speed within the same pisswater stream results in a net rotational force, like a football thrown for a pass, or a bullet fired from a rifle. <br><br>You can see this rotation in action when you observe the end of your dickhole while you are going pee pee. You will see the pisswater at the very tip of the dickhole as a perfect laminar stream in the shape of an elliptic cylinder. Then, about an inch from the dickhole, the pisswater stream will make a perfect ninety degree turn. You are now looking at the side of the stream. Then, an inch or so further down, thee pee pee will rotate 90 degrees again, and you&#039;ll be looking at the bottom. This spiral of pisswater will continue until the flow breaks up into individual droplets, spattering the face of the Puerto Rican girl you have hired for the evening.<br><br>I&#039;m Neil Degrasse Tyson.

I&#039;m on 60mg of vyvanse, I get freaked out that my hearts gonna explode when I&#039;m 35 (20 rn) despite not having any negative side effects. Take weekends off, and take any day you aren&#039;t needing to study with it off to keep tolerance low. In my experience, it makes me incredibly motivated to do something as mundane as shovel shit, and care about said shit, which is what gets me to focus, as long as I care about what I&#039;m doing I&#039;ll rip through it in no time (so it helps when you need an extra push). Vyvanse is a fucking wonder drug, no headaches, no bruxism, no &quot;rush&quot;, and it&#039;s a relaxed come down if you tell yourself that the withdrawal is what&#039;s making you feel weird (irritable, depressed, etc). Plus it lasts for 8 hours (sometimes more or less depending on person) so by the time it&#039;s out of you, you&#039;ve just studied for 8 fucking hours straight. Adderall is opposite for me, you feel cracked out and fucking tense and ready to punch holes in walls, more focused on that then what you need to study. Long-term affects of it have been studied and there hasn&#039;t been anything of concern unless you already have heart problems, just don&#039;t do it everyday for 5 fucking years, use it to get through the hump, remember the skills you learned with it, and be done with it. And treat it is a medication not a drug, dont you fucking dare take more than what you&#039;re prescribed unless talking to your doctor. It&#039;s a nice tool to have until you&#039;ve started slamming 2x60mg pills a day just to feel high, then it&#039;s time to chew in a shotgun barrel.

The Anglos (not Darwin per se) created a deranged view of nature as a marketplace, as the ideas of Adam Smith trickled into Malthus then from Malthus to Darwin. The Ruskies had their tradition of communal steppe-host/horde biology, which I&#039;m less familiar with but which ran through Kropotkin and his views on mutual aid as a factor in evolution. All perspectives apply well in certain situations and are hot garbage in other contexts. Western scientists will tell you that race has no biological basis, which is obviously retarded because it&#039;s centred on inherited, visually observable physical characteristics. We can pretend we&#039;re better than all that, or we can climb a bit above our culture by recognising that W*stuloids (Westuloids) have a bunch of political-cultural junk floating around in their brains, like thrown away takeaway cups in an otherwise limpid puddle.

The notion of &quot;moving backward in time&quot; is nonsensical in a Hamiltonian formulation, because the whole description can only go forward in time. That&#039;s the definition of what the Hamiltonian does - it takes you forward in time a little bit. So if you formulate quantum mechanics the Hamiltonian way, this idea is difficult to understand (still it can be done - Stueckelberg discovered this connection before the path integral, when field Hamiltonians were the only tool).<br><br>But in Feynman&#039;s particle path-integral picture, when you parametrize particles by their worldline proper time, and you renounce a global causal picture in favor of particles splitting and joining, the particle trajectories are consistent with relativity, but only if the trajectories include back-in-time trajectories, where coordinate time ticks in the opposite sense to proper time.<br><br>Looked at in the Hamiltonian formalism, the coordinate time is the only notion of time. So those paths where the proper time ticks in the reverse direction look like a different type of particle, and these are the antiparticles.<br><br>Sometimes there is an idenification, so that a particle is its own antiparticle.",,,,,,,,1613010093,,,12692052,,,,,,12692052,,,,,,sci

It is important to understand that T is an operator on physical states, it does not abstractly flip time, it concretely flips all momenta and angular momenta (a spinning disk is spinning the other way), so that things are going backwards. The parity operator flips all directions, but not angular momenta.<br><br>The CPT theorem says that any process involving matter happens exactly the same when done in reverse motion, in a mirror, to antimatter.<br><br>The CPT operator is never the identity, aside from the case of a real scalar field. CPT acting on an electron produces a positron state, for example. CPT acting on a photon produces a photon going in the same direction with opposite polarization (if P is chosen to reflect all spatial coordinate axes, this is a bad convention outside of 3+1 dimensions).<br><br>This theorem is proved by noting that a CPT operator corresponds to a rotation by 180 degrees in the Euclidean theory, as described on Wikipedia.",,,,,,,,1613010125,,,12692052,,,,,,12692052,,,,,,sci

In tree-level perturbation theory, these amplitudes are analytic except when creating physical particles, where you find poles. So the scattering amplitudes make sense for any complex value of the momenta, since going around poles is not a problem.<br><br>In terms of mandelstam variables for 2-2 scattering, s,t,u (s is the CM energy, t is the momentum transfer and u the other momentum transfer, to the other created particle), the amplitude is an analytic function of s and t. The regions where the particles are on the mass shell are given by mandelstam plot, and there are three different regions, corresponding to A+B goes to C+D , Cbar + B goes to Abar+ D, and A + Dbar goes to C+Bbar. These three regimes are described by the exact same function of s,t,u, in three disconnected regions.<br><br>In starker terms, if you start with pure particle scattering, and analyticaly continue the amplitudes with particles with incoming momentum k&#039;s (with positive energy) to negative k&#039;s, you find the amplitude for the antiparticle process. The antiparticle amplitude is uniquely determined by the analytic contination of the particle amplitude for the energy-momentum reversed.<br><br>This corresponds to taking the outgoing particle with positive energy and momentum, and flipping the energy and momentum to negative values, so that it goes out the other way with negative energy. If you identify the lines in Feynman diagrams with particle trajectories, this region of the amplitude gives the contribution of paths that go back in time.<br><br>So crossing is the other precise statement of &quot;Antimatter is matter going back in time&quot;.",,,,,,,,1613010156,,,12692052,,,,,,12692052,,,,,,sci
2104,12692071,,,02/10/21(Wed)21:23:06,cont.,"Causal pictures<br>The notion of going back in time is acausal, meaning it is excluded automatically in a Hamiltonian formulation. For this reason, it took a long time for this approach to be appreciated and accepted. Stueckelberg proposed this interpretation of antiparticles in the late 1930s, but Feynman&#039;s presentation made it stick.<br><br>In Feynman diagrams, the future is not determined from the past by stepping forward timestep by timestep, it is determined by tracing particle paths proper-time by proper-time. The diagram formalism therefore is philosophically very different from the Hamiltonian field theory formalism, so much so Feynman was somewhat disappointed that they were equivalent.<br><br>They are not as easily equivalent when you go to string theory, because string theory is an S-matrix theory formulated entirely in Feynman language, not in Hamiltonian language. The Hamiltonian formulation of strings requires a special slicing of space time, and even then, it is less clear and elegant than the Feynman formulation, which is just as acausal and strange. The strings backtrack in time just like particles do, since they reproduce point particles at infinite tension.<br><br>If you philosophically dislike acausal formalisms, you can say (in field theory) that the Hamiltonian formalism is fundamental, and that you believe in crossing and CPT, and then you don&#039;t have to talk about going back in time. Since crossing and CPT are the precise manifestations of the statement that antimatter is matter going back in time, you really aren&#039;t saying anything different, except philosophically.

Standard laboratory techniques ultra centrifugation, band extraction, electron microscopy and FC. If you want I can explain it in detail and give the literature. Regularly done e.g. with mega viruses (which is a misnomer), bacteriophages (also a misnomer) and all kinds of cell parts, most notably apoptotic bodies and EVs. Their trick is, they claim it’s an obligate intra cellular parasite, hence it‘s somehow magically jumps from host to host and you can’t find it in body fluids for some reasons. Just after you mix it with aforementioned ingredients it manifests. In the 1930th and 1940th they searched (with the electron microscope) for it that way and couldn’t find it. After most virologists had given up, Enders came along around 1955 and started inducing the current in vitro nonsense. It was with measles. When he poisoned the cells with antibiotics and starved them of fetal bovine serum. He saw the syncytia formation (giant cells). And assumed it was cytopathic effects caused by viral replication. He looked in the electron microscope and shaw the apoptotic bodies, which he called measles virions. <br>Negative control line, dummy or mock infections are never serious. They just use the medium, not the body fluids of non infected individuals or individuals with inflammations caused by something else and not the antibiotics etc. Nowadays some try to hide the real methodology in a supplementary appendix or just don’t publish it, which means it won’t reach the eyes of anybody other than the usual people.

That’s the reason we have found the sequences in old waste water samples or in animals. And why you can test posting again and again (long COVID-19 and testing positive after 60 days again). The amount of different mRNA sequences is much larger than the genome itself, since mRNA can be processed and doesn’t have to correspond to an existing sequence in the DNA. If you are ill that means, there will be more damaged cells leaking mRNA and certain sequences of mRNA related to proteins dealing with the illness at hand (could be anything), hence more mRNA of this type (which the test likely is biased for since the theoretical genome was picked together from samples of sick people) and more mRNA in general. Therefore there is an elevated chance to test positive by qRT-PCR. Same goes for samples that are taken with a lot of force or moving the swab around for a long time, since there is more genetic material, which means elevated risk the mRNA molecules can be found. <br>The conclusion can only be it’s useless.

In the trials, where all the animals die/get severely ill, because the next emerging thing is so scary inbreed animals very sensitive to everything are used. Unrelated, has anybody seen the toxicology data one these supposedly mice or ferret adapted Mers-Cov and pH1N1 strains/supernatants? Many of these commercially available lab animals even have hints attached to what purposes they should be. Like suited for x,y and z. Many of them almost completely lack a microbiome, which is advertised. They basically drop dead, if you look at them the wrong way. And if that’s not enough, there is the variant with the wrecked genome. Humanized mice for example the ones with the ACE-2 receptor. Strange, how ACE-2 is really rare in the human respiratory tract, but SARS-CoV-2 is still spreading so well. But I’m sure, that can’t have anything to do with Influenza A, B and C disappearing. Many non human primates also fall into this category. Or in the words of a famous virologist monkeys exaggerate. Maybe that also has something to with green monkey kidney epithelium cells being used in the monolayers, but what do I know. <br>If the test is about the animals surviving the toxic bombardment, to prove the next wonderful cure has arrived, the preferred animals are different.

The plaque assays aren’t really modern, basically that’s the same. Safe for some new cell lines and small changes in the formulation of the medium etc. I have yet to see a pure sample being used and scientifically characterized like it should. Interestingly enough the knowledge of how sequences motives, which are being assumed to belong to viruses look, is derived from the characteristic of bacteriophages. For which the proper procedures were truly done and hence we know how the sequences really look. The thing is the virus is assumed a priori, but from other disciplines we know cell lines can die for any number of reason. Before I forget it the phages aren’t really poisonous dead things that attack bacteria. You can think of them as “sperm” and super control structures in a certain group or bacteria. They transfer energy and information from one bacteria to another. Hence even this analogy with the viruses is probably completely flawed.

I sincerely doubt asexuality exists genuinely outside these individuals. If anyone claims otherwise, they are either prepubescent trying to cope with their bodily changes (asexuality can be seen as a defence from overt sexuality, which is something young girls have trouble with especially) or have comorbidity with mental disorders like depression and anxiety. Studies have shown that those who identify as asexual have a higher propensity to have mental disorders and low self esteem and may possibly cling to an asexual identity to protect themselves - For example, a man could identify as asexual after being sexually assaulted in his youth and having negative connotations with sexuality thereafter.<br><br>T.

Current &quot;neural networks&quot; used in deep learning are nothing like biological neural networks. Deep learning has very poor algorithmic scaling compared to bio neural nets (think big O notation), because it&#039;s based on dense computations while bio nets use sparse activations. Individual neurons are much less energy efficient than the nanometer scale transistors used in modern computer chips, and yet the human brain is on the order of millions of times more energy efficient than GPU-based deep learning, because the brain has better algorithmic efficiency. We need algorithmic breakthroughs that mimic the sparse activations of bio nets in order to make a true, scalable AI. However, once that happens, you better buckle up because our hardware is far superior to the human brain and you&#039;re going to see some crazy superintelligence shit happen overnight once we figure out the software part.<br><br>t. deep learning engineer",1612588184015m,.jpg,1024.0,1005.0,125.0,122.0,1612910180079.0,1612910180,OVRSIzc3/ZebCMpgkni1kw==,64198.0,12686575,,,,,,12686575,,,,,,sci

3009,12683085,,,02/08/21(Mon)16:45:51,Anonymous,"I have a hypothesis. I think that when a women has a daughter the mother naturally develops a sense of competition with her daughter in regards to seeking attention and approval from the husband. With this being the case the daughter is most likely treated better than the daughter in regards to the affection that the father gives off to his daughter as opposed to the wife, as in the dad will still argue with the mom and treat her as he normally does but he ends up treating his daughter much better than his wife because he is naturally more attracted to his daughter as a protector due to her being a directly related to him. This causes the mother to feel a plethora of emotions that most likely will fester negatively, the mother may notice that her husband treats his daughter better than her and as a result develops resentment, which eventually leads to divorce, the other reason is the rebellious nature of 2 women versus 1 man in close proximity, women tend to be the more social and emotional gender of the two, so of course they are more prone to judging people, in this case most likely they judge the husband/father many times, also once a girl starts to go through puberty she will most likely look and judge many men, this same attitude will pass onto her mother when she views other men and they will both have a steady amount of time comparing and contrasting other men to the father of the house by constantly having him compared, tv is a major component of this as is social media of course because you&#039;re constantly comparing. Also the possibility of the dad having sex with his own daughter which i believe happens more times than people believe.",1612704163739,.jpg,928.0,1041.0,111.0,125.0,1612820751954.0,1612820751,Z1F3eEyqYopAqvkAVRY3Hw==,112332.0,12676270,,,,,,12676270,,,,,,sci

It is not likely to be applicable in the real world based on the viruses we know to be seasonal like influenza.

I&#039;ll use the Pfizer vaccine as an example for obvious reasons. <br><br>As I understand it, mRNA gets absorbed by cells, causing them to produce spike proteins. When the cells die, the spike proteins are picked up by professional antigen-presenting cells, which present fragments of the spike protein on their surface for helper T-cells to detect. The helper T-cells then activate B cells and killer T-cells, the latter of which destroys any cells which display the spike protein fragments on their surface. <br><br>I can&#039;t find anything which says why that couldn&#039;t result in a massive immune response to your own cells if the spike proteins proliferate.

I&#039;m not sure what a full reversal would look like, but at a smaller level, perhaps a gravity wave lag idea first. It seems to me that gravity waves travel with light waves. Summarized by the thought experiment that if the sun dematerialized, earth would orbit that spot for another 8 minutes, until the light stopped arriving.<br>Accordingly, If there was a way to slow down these signals relative to ones surroundings the force of gravity would act first on it, than on you, giving an anti-gravity like affect. Make the light orbit around you, I&#039;d imagine the signal would never reach you. I&#039;d hypothesize than that time would travel slower inside the craft, than outside, creating that early 2000&#039;s movie clockstoppers style timetravel.<br><br>pic related reminds me of surfing, the alcubierre warp metric",metric-(whatever-this-is),.jpg,1081.0,742.0,125.0,85.0,1612758373833.0,1612758373,bSV7ScSuzcAtWQQQQS0J+g==,131893.0,12680024,,,,,,12680024,,,,,,sci

I can&#039;t really make much of a conclusion as n -&gt; infty as there aren&#039;t really any nice convergence properties in play. You might wanna read up on Cantor&#039;s Diagonal arguement to get a better feel for these sorts of problems. For instance, there&#039;s no bijection between the natural numbers and [0,1] even though both &quot;look&quot; pretty infinite!<br><br>Infinitesimals are only really formalized in non-standard analysis, with each number being treated as a series. The intuition behind them appear in a graduate-level analysis course as the Radon-Nikodym theorem, and that&#039;s pretty standard.<br><br>Willard&#039;s General Topology has an introduction that discusses these set theoretic issues; the proof-arguement style may seem a bit offputting at first, but I feel its a good place to get introduced to more formal &quot;rigorous&quot; mathematics. It&#039;d be better to run somewhere with the material after getting acquainted with the first 10 chapters, i.e. start an analysis book or something like Milnor&#039;s Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint. <br><br>Lieb-Loss&#039;s Analysis book is also really good, and it has a ton of really nice physical applications..It ends with some really nice problems in the calculus of variations, and it does a lot of groundwork for putting a lower bound on the Schrodinger operator, i.e. proving molecules and atoms are stable!",,,,,,,,1612920158,,,12687847,,,,,,12687847,,,,,,sci

Instead, you should focus on things you enjoy and on things that allow you to feel even a little bit of self worth through achieving something.

Hmm, to figure out whether 3 is or isn&#039;t a natural number, we just need to go through ALL the sets (cardinality issues aside), for each subset check whether or not it&#039;s inductive (that is, check if it contains the empty set and then go through ALL the elements of that set x, and check if {x} is in the set), and then check whether 3 is in that set. If it&#039;s true for ALL such subsets, then you can say that 3 is in the set. Be careful not to miss any sets, because you might think you have a number, but it could turn out that it&#039;s a nonstandard number, that there is an inductive set which doesn&#039;t have that number in it. To figure out how to go through ALL the sets, well here buddy you&#039;re on your own, since ZFC only tells you that some things are sets but does not tell you what isn&#039;t a set.",,,,,,,,1612736450,,,12668218,,,,,,12668218,,,,,,sci

Of these, there are some that only exceed certain values a finite number of times: e.g. x_n = 1/n is bounded above by 1 but only x_1, x_2, and x_3 are greater than 1/4. Therefore, 1/4 is a supremum of the series for n &gt; 3. The lim sup is the limit of the suprema as we cut off more and more of the early terms. In the example I give it&#039;s obvious that as we exclude more and more of the early terms, our supremum approaches zero; therefore, limsup x_n = 0. From this definition, it&#039;s clear to see that the limsup is simply the greatest accumulation point of a series, and likewise with liminf.

You want to send the kids on a school bus, but it only has k seats. You could do this by picking your k favorite kids, leaving n-k behind, or you could just pick your n-k least favorites and get the rest to go on the bus. But it&#039;s clear that either method you use, you&#039;ll have assign the kids into two categories: the ones you like more and the ones you like less--in other words, picking your favorite k out of n has the same effect as picking your least favorite n-k out of k, and vice versa. Therefore, for each assignment you get from the first method, you could have gotten it from the second.<br><br>An example: say the bus has n-1 seats.<br><span class=""quote"">&gt; I rank the kids in order of my preference and I pick out the top n-1 and let them go on the bus.</span><br><span class=""quote"">&gt; I rank the kids in order of my preference and I pick out the kid on the bottom and make them stay home.</span><br>It should be clear that both these methods are basically doing the same thing.<br><br>The reason it&#039;s present in pascal&#039;s triangle is because nCk = (n-1)Ck + (n-1)C(k-1). You can see that as follows:<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;If I need to pick k out of n kids to go on the bus, I either let Billy get on or I don&#039;t. If Billy&#039;s not going, I need to choose k from the remaining n-1 (now excluding Billy). If Billy&#039;s going, I need to choose k-1 (since Billy&#039;s already taking up a seat) from the remaining n-1.</span>",,,,,,,,1612835214,,,12668218,,,,,,12668218,,,,,,sci

These relational frames that they choose are basically in everything we do cognitively, whether we are conscious of them or not. For example: There is no &quot;left&quot; without &quot;right&quot; and no &quot;same&quot; without &quot;different&quot; or &quot;opposite.&quot;<br><br>I think a lot of what we do cognitively is arguably unconscious. A lot of things going on in the background that we don&#039;t account for. I think training these relational frames is essentially behavioral training to change a bit of how our unconscious mind processes things. The more fluent you are in these relations, the better your cognitive prowess.

They inhabit some odd place in between.</span><br>Idk if thats a good way to put it at all. You gotta consider that proteins and ribosomes don&#039;t need a cell wall or nuclease or any of that shit, in order to do their thing. Now sure cellular life has many forms of containment around its different types of proteins, but at the end of the day &quot;living&quot; life still works through the exact same mechanisms that viruses, viroids, and prions work. Its just that our cells or plant cells or bacteria are able to create our own proteins with ribosomes(which are just special bundled up masses of proteins themselves). Whereas the former all only contain their genetic material and require other cells with working and well fed ribosomes/proteins in order to do any work/make any structures. <br><br>IMO if you wanna start thinking about the origin of life, RNA and and molecular folding is where it starts. Strands of RNA form easily enough should the building blocks for them coexist in a fairly well contained space. All it really took was the right strand being in the right place and right time. I imagine life started when a clump nucleotides just randomly folded together in just the right way to make the first proto-ribosome, and from there on little protein machines went about making random shit till they eventually became unstable and died. Somewhere down the line though, is an ribosome that managed to fold its own containment which then kept it stable for longer. Lipid rich gas bubbles from a geo-thermal vent probably helped in this regard.",image.imageformat.fullwidthwidepage.1508643569,.jpg,1286.0,687.0,125.0,66.0,1613000125658.0,1613000125,ijrkPjxaMSlmJU6l4ySWbQ==,136339.0,12691433,,,,,,12691433,,,,,,sci

Evolution only cares about the reproductive cycle, not anything else that happens beyond it. So the genetic code for birth, growth, and maturity may as well be evolutionarily perfected. As most people are strong and healthy until way into old age. But the genetic code for error correction and maintaining DNA quality ultimately isn&#039;t necessary and maybe even gets in the way of some things, like environment based adaptations(like skin tans, or scars, as human examples). <br><br>Yeah sure in an ideal evolution world everyone lives forever, produces unlimited offspring, and its basically animal heaven. But when it comes to this world and this universe, things are really harsh, resources are limited, and it takes a hilarious amount of effort to do anything especially if you start factoring in the relative sizes of every&#039;thing&#039;.",,,,,,,,1613001844,,,12691433,,,,,,12691433,,,,,,sci

That gives us radiation protection from the sun and cosmic rays.<br>It protects all colony domes across the whole of Mars from tinier micrometeorites which would just burn up in the atmosphere. They&#039;re just not an issue ever again! (There would of course be a minimum size at which they did still bust through that 0.3 bar atmosphere, and domes would still require urgent repair mechanisms).<br>The atmosphere would make every dome on the planet easier to build because it would be less prone to explosive decompression, increasing the size and viability of some of the valley-covering dome habitats.<br>It lets us walk on Mars in plain clothes (with an oxygen breather mask of course), meaning you could cycle a bike long distances out in the open with a light breather pack and mask, repair your domes easier, mine resources, and basically live on the surface of an alien world far, far easier.<br>It melts water ice, creating oceans and a rain cycle, which will eventually wash out the perchlorates in the regolith.<br>This in turn allows plants and trees and farming on the surface and plankton in the oceans. All that about 100 years after the million-strong colony starts releasing super-greenhouse gases. Why move nitrogen from other planets if Mars has enough that &#039;just&#039; needs baking out of its rocks?

On the one hand, we know that early primordial protozoa were basic proteins that absorbed other proteins via osmosis, and replicated. We know these protozoa arose from purely chemical reactions. We also know that replication began as a purely chemical process, and each stage of replication had an element of randomness associated with it. This is evolution, wherein these random mutations made it easier for these protozoa to replicate. <br><br>Where things get fuzzier are the transition periods from single cell organisms to multicellular organisms, from reptile to mammals, etc. We know the transition existed due to genetic similarity across all life. The origin of human consciousness, in this framework, suggests that it&#039;s mostly an illusion. This is supported by psychology research. For example, you cannot reason yourself through emotions. You cannot use logic to stop crying nor can you use reason to stop being angry.

This has been proven by the Miller experiments and its replications. <br>Step two, DNA or RNA. So you have a soup of amino acyds, basic proteins, and nucleobases, nucleic acyds. Here begins chemical evolution. Chemicals can replicate, change conformations of other chemicals etc. Prions are a good current example of chemical evolution. At this point whatever replicates/ spreads fastest will survive at the highest rate. Basic systems formed where nucleyc acyds helped replicate proteins and these proteins helped replicate the nucleic acyds.<br>Step three these chemicals separate into contained units. Phosphlypids have a hydrophobic side, so it naturaly can adhere to proteins. These basic replicating systems become separate entities surounded by a membrane.<br>Step four. At this point you can start thinking evolution. Whatever can replicate fastest will be present in larger quantities and replicate even more etc, etc. If it has replication, mutation, and inheritable traits, it can evolve, and if populations can be prevented from swapping RNA or DNA, speciation can happan. From this point to the present, the rest can be explained by a huge variety of evolutionary mechanisms.<br>Consciousness is a different question, it is probable, that its mor of a mistake than anything.

There is the fourth possibility that for whatever reason this is the universe that came int existance, or has always existed, and we think it is fine tuned for us, or for its own existance, but realy we are q part of it and a consequence of it. If any other universe would have formed and something capable of thought were to form in it, they too might think it is fine tuned for existance and for them. Maybe the universe can exist in 4 or 5 or x ways, and it just so happened to form like this. There might be constants, and rules, but maybe they arent constant, they cycle through all possible values, and the universe conformes to its ever changing rules. It would always seem like the rules are fine tuned for this particular exitance which one might wrongly assume to be the only possible one.<br>Either way, god is no answer, it just poses more questions.

Its hard to extrapolate further from just one point of data, so we dont know weather this is the only way it can be, or if there are multiple and we live in the one that allows for our existance, or there were multiple subsequent iterations and we exist in the one that allowes for us. The universe isnt fine tuned for us, the same way mikorhiza arent fine tuned for trees. They evolved in that context, if they evolved in a different context, they wouldnt be fine tuned for tree roots, they would be fine tuned for whatever different context they evolved in. The universe seems fine tuned for us, because we evolved/ ended up existing in this one. A different species from a possible different universe might also think the universe is fine tuned for them.<br>As for your second answer, i know mentioning fallacies is kind of reddit, so apologies, but this kind of sounds like a god of the gaps situation. The hard problem of consciousness is a preplexing one, and we might find the answer in something totaly unexpected or novel. Quantum mechanics is already poking holes in the nice comfy, intuitive and wrong notion of discreet particles in a void. My problem with the god argument is that at the very least, cause and efect seem to be a thing. There are rules of what is and isnt posible. Even if there is a god, there is still the question of what is he, and why and how. God doesent answer how the world works, it just puts another layer of questions between us and the way the world works. <br>Your third point, you are right.

One a metabolic dysfunction caused by abdominal fat acting as an endocrine signaller and disrupter of organ function, almost all these people are obese with fatty liver. Two it&#039;s a problem of metabolic function caused by genetic inefficiencies of enzymes in metabolic processes, we only really know about the pathologies of inborn errors of metabolism when they are total and infants die of them, we know little about sub-optimal inborn errors of metabolism that may only present as these vague symptoms in adults because some metabolic step in only functioning at 10% of what it would in a healthy person.<br><br>The fix I would attempt is body recomposition to lose all abdominal fat by a protein sparing very low carbohydrate diet. Don&#039;t worry about exercise until diet has stripped off all the fat. The second would be to megadose b vitamins like riboflavin and other conditionally essential nutrients (like choline, betaine, creatine etc.) and hope to find one or more where megadosing or supplementing can blast past a sub-optimal inborn error of metabolism.<br><br>The other factor could be gut dysbiosis. Harder there and a lot may be fixed by body recomposition and not eating to excess. Option would be nuking the gut biome with antibiotics and replacing with fecal transfer from a healthy person.",,,,,,,,1612924576,,,12687424,,,,,,12687424,,,,,,sci
