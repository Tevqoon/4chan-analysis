You have to jailbreak it so you can read more than just pdf, but once you do jailbreak it its quite powerful. The build quality is really quite good and its so thin and light it feels like nothing. definitely could survive a drop because it weighs so little. the stylus is okay and you have to charge it but for reading on? its unreal. I got it off amazon &quot;2nd hand&quot; but it ended up being unused for basically half the price of what it normally costs. If you can find one cheap, its great.

It shows that you had an idea, then architected, designed, and implemented it. Interviewers like seeing these. However, none of that matters if your application never makes it to a human. The most important thing is putting all of those frameworks and languages into your resume after working with them. All initial candidate consideration these days is just a program parsing your resume for a list of keywords. Make sure you have as many words matching the job description as possible. This is the only way to get your foot in the door and make it past those initial flush letters. Tailor the resume to each job by adding or removing some lines or words to match the job description better.

You can buy some kapton tape pretty cheaply. Be aware, only the 8+ TB models are going to be guaranteed to use CMR rather than SMR, as per public statements from Western Digital addressing the outcry over false, or lack, of information surrounding the technology used to read/write to their drives. It’s a working theory that shucking is now somewhat of a gamble compared to previous decades. Before, it was truly relabeled WD Red drives inside. Now, it’s a crap-shoot. It could be Blues, it could be 14 TB drives forced down to 12 TB, it could be Ultrastar. It all comes down to the batch the drive was produced in (i.e. the month + year). Generally speaking, I’ve had pretty good luck in the past two years, so take this advice with a grain of salt.",,,,,,,,1612915230,,,80119346,,,,,,80119346,,,,,,,,,,g

Passable for the fanless Air, but on a Pro it looks like more is needed, the 16&quot; still beats the M1 13&quot; Pro equipped with a fan in a few categories.

That was a true hold over product if you really needed it as A14 wasn&#039;t ready and they wouldn&#039;t want to show their hand with A14/M1 earlier than the iPad Air/iPhone 12 anyway, at the time iPad Pro A12X was still impressive enough, they also needed something new to launch the Magic Keyboard with, and again, 5nm wasn&#039;t ready, so no A14 Air, no A14 Pro, give the best of what we have now. M1X would be a perfect stopgap for the Mac because you can add an M2 if it&#039;s even released in 2021 to the top of both 14&quot;-16&quot; and iMac lineups that start with an M1X. Just add a higher config, not unheard of. Why would M1X be half assed, exactly? More ports, better GPU, god willing more cores, what&#039;s not to like?

Is slackware a good choice? I liked gentoo because of USE flags which were a massive help in getting my entire system to work with jack. Is there anything as customizable? Guix seems to be the new hot thing to shill because reproducible builds, but my understanding it’s solely for ultra free software, and unfortunately I need some non-free software. NixOS is also hailed as very customizable but I hear it breaks if you deviate from the normal config too much and it uses systemd. It’s not pottering hate, I just generally prefer runit. Is void the best option? How does xbps-source work. Is it comparable to portage? Anything like useflags?

BOTTOM. That specific song is also the most ideal for quest, for songs with backswings the tracking won&#039;t just be inaccurate, but when the controller will be positioned outside of the camera with backswings you will at times lose tracking completely, which is gamebreaking. Same goes for all fast paced games and games with archery. controllers go behind you, there is a chance you will lose tracking. I for one could never unholster my sword in boneworks because the tracking didn&#039;t go that far back. It is NOT a marginal barely noticable difference, there are multiple games where you will be severely crippled. for example, Eleven table tennis, The lab&#039;s archery game, Elven assassin, climbey, etc. The inaccuracy is just the cherry on top which is also going to cripple you in competitive situations if you&#039;re that kind of player in aiming with guns and ANY rythm game (synth riders, audica etc.)<br><br><span class=""quote"">&gt;multiple power cables</span><br>this is like saying<br><span class=""quote"">&gt;Desktop PC?

What people find astounding is that MacOS no longer uses it on low DPI monitors either.  Apple removed it completely for all displays, not just for &quot;retina&quot; displays.<br><br>Of course greed is the reason why.   In doing this, Apple makes low DPI displays look worse than they otherwise would, including the low DPI displays on older models of their own computers.   For instance I have a 2015 macbook air collecting dust in some drawer somewhere.  That computer is only 6 years old, but has a low DPI 720p screen.   Modern versions of MacOS, without subpixel anti-aliasing, would look like absolute ass on that display (moreso than a 720p screen already looks like ass...)   This will doubtlessly induce some macbook air owners to purchase a new computer from Apple, which I have no doubt is the intent of the change.",,,,,,,,1612986769,,,80129604,,,,,,80129604,,,,,,,,,,g

An Aeron is not comfortable out of the gate and may not be comfortable even after adjusting it to hell and back.

He is still super butthurt that Linux beet HURD (but hey, HURD just got basic sound support in 2016!) and basically tries to claim Linux because Linus used GCC and the GNU coreutils. He survives on the charity of others and speaking engagements where he spouts his insane, paranoid, philosophy. Basically he won&#039;t be happy until all the programmers are homeless hackers like him and all the companies are shut down. How people are supposed to support themselves and their families in that scenario aren&#039;t things he has to deal with because he is basically a permanent grad student. He does make some good points about privacy, but for him, there is no middle ground. Anything that may reduce your privacy even the slightest bit (like movie recommendations on Netflix) is evil according to him, and must be destroyed. In a lot of ways he show classic signs of mental splitting, which is a classic symptom of mental illness. To top it off, when he does write code, he does so in the style of the awful GNU style guide which is a crime against humanity IMHO.<br><br>So, in a nutshell:<br>He&#039;s a bird-fucking, self-absorbed, power hungry, toe jam eating pedophile that thinks everything should be free and everyone should be forced to share, who looks like he hasn&#039;t showered in years so as to create a static shield around his body to protect from aliens.

And I don’t really belong in the world anymore. And in some ways I feel I ought to be dead.” Now, meeting over Chinese food, he reaffirms this. “I have certainly wished I had killed myself when I was born,” he says. “In terms of effect on the world, it’s very good that I’ve lived.

Literally 0 input lag from analog input, reaction time independent of content and lower than other monitors. Viewing angles are great. Depending on the model great viewability even under light. Colors even on cheap a CRT look as good or better than on very expensive  flatscreens. <br><br>The Problems though: A high pitched sound that&#039;s intrinsic to how they work based on lines being drawn per second.<br>Heavy and big as fuck, even worse when you want something that&#039;s big enough for you to lay with your feet towards the screen and some space to walk between the screen and the couch, we&#039;re talking 2.5m distance at least, which would mean you need a 1.25m screen, so 49 inches for a comfy viewing experience. <br>Quite power hungry, but shouldn&#039;t be that big of a concern. Also good luck getting one with a higher resolution than 1080i. <br>The picture/color/black values advantage they have fade compared to good oled screens. <br><br>TL;DR: Get a ~20 inch or smaller one for retro (or anything with an analog output) games, the extremely low lag is great.

So you can&#039;t tweak a CRT monitor that&#039;s rated for, say, 1024x768 or 1280x1024 for anything higher. Even if you can manage to crank up the horizontal oscillator to get it to lock without blowing up the whole high-power horizontal section, the pixel pitch on the CRT itself will make it look like shit.<br>This isn&#039;t even addressing the bandwidth of the electron gun amplifiers, which of course is limited; exceed their bandwidth or their slewing rate, and you get smearing.<br>Of course you can effectively get more resolution out of a monochrome CRT, but that&#039;s monochrome.

LCD didn&#039;t overtake tubes in color accurate work until ~2009 when the first LED-lit reference monitors started coming out. LCDs have a laundry list of motion issues which are only solved on very few of the best available gaming monitors, as well as having imperfect viewing angles, black levels and uniformity. We essentially sidegraded in image quality for cost and power usage reasons. It sucks, but I&#039;m not super jaded about it anymore, I&#039;ll just switch directly from CRT to OLED when that&#039;s possible.<br><a href=""#p80138197"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;80138197</a><br>No, more than 4K is needed at 40 degree viewing angle. 6K to 8K I&#039;d say is around ideal for most scenarios. In fact, it&#039;s quite desirable for resolution to be much higher than what you can discern for scaling and text rendering reasons. 16K or higher may be needed for VR or wall-sized displays or some other theoretical future tech.<br>Laserdisc doesn&#039;t have anything approaching infinite res.

2391,80124593,,,02/10/21(Wed)02:38:15,Anonymous,"Rust breaks a lot of stuff, and in ways that are difficult to fix. This can have a chilling effect on users, particularly those on older or slower hardware. Rust has only one implementation, with a very narrow set of supported platforms, tens of millions of lines of C++ code, and no specification. Rust ostensibly supports several dozen targets, but only the tier 1 platforms can be reasonably expected to work. As someone who has tried to bootstrap Rust (and failed) for even a tier-two platform, I can assure you that it’s a nightmare. Bringing it up for an entirely new target would be a hellish experience. Ask any distribution packager who works with Rust to share their horror stories — they have many.<br><br>The Rust cargo cult needs to pause and re-evaluate. Switching to Rust breaks things for anyone who steps even a toe out of the norm of Linux/macOS/Windows on x86_64 or aarch64. Even on the supported platforms it comes with a substantial burden on build requirements, calling for 10× to 100× or more RAM, CPU time, and power usage. Whatever its benefits, choosing Rust is ultimately choosing to lock a large group of people out of your project, and dooming many more to struggle and frustration. These are real trade-offs that you need to seriously consider.",,,,,,,,1612942695,,,80124530,,,,,,80124530,,,,,,,,,,g

Well, here’s a moral argument: throwing away serviceable computers every couple of years to upgrade is a privilege that not all of your users have, contributes to climate change, and fills up landfills. As far as security is concerned, some matters demand leaving the norm: old hardware is the only kind that can avoid proprietary firmware blobs, Intel ME or AMD PSP, and UEFI. Novel hardware which addresses issues like microcode and open hardware, like POWER9 and RISC-V, are also suffering under Rust’s mainstream-or-bust regime. Anyone left behind is forced to use the legacy C codebase you’ve abandoned, which is much worse for their security than the hypothetical bugs you’re trying to save them from.<br><br>C is not memory safe. It suffers from undefined behavior. These are valid complaints. However, C code can be secure! Just look at seL4, which I guarantee you has fewer bugs than, say, RedoxOS. There are plenty of C programs which aren’t formally verified that work fine, too. Rewriting your code in Rust is always going to introduce new bugs, including security bugs, that wouldn’t be there if you just maintained the C code. Maybe there are undiscovered bugs lurking in your C codebase, but as your codebase ages under continuous maintenance, that number will only shrink.<br><br>A working C toolchain (say, cproc and qbe) can be written in a couple tens of thousands of lines of code. The only working Rust toolchain is tens of millions of lines of C++ and Rust code. How many undiscovered bugs do you think these two toolchains have when compared? How many of those are security issues? How much relative work would it be to debug them, or port them to new — or old — platforms? How often do these respective codebases churn, creating a larger maintenance burden and introducing new bugs/vulnerabilities? I can bootstrap a working C toolchain in about 10 minutes. I spent a week trying to do that for Rust, and failed. That matters.",,,,,,,,1612942756,,,80124530,,,,,,80124530,,,,,,,,,,g

There are legitimate reasons to prefer C, both technical and moral, and Rust still needs a lot of work before it’s ready for the prime time in systems which prioritize stability, reliability, simplicity, and accessibility. Those of us who work with such systems, we feel like the Rust community has put its thumbs into its collective ears, sung “la la la” to our problems, and proceeded to stomp all over the software ecosystem like a toddler playing “Godzilla” with their Lego, all the while yelling at us old fogies for being old and fogey.<br><br>To the Rust team: it’s time to calm down. Slow down the language, write a specification, focus on improving your tier 2 and tier 3 targets, expand to more platforms, and work on performance, stability, and accessibility. Invest more in third-party implementations like rust-gcc. I spent almost a week, full-time, trying to bring up Rust for riscv64-musl. The bootstrap process is absolutely miserable. Your ecosystem has real problems that affect real people.

Wayland has no 100% working implementations, with a very narrow set of supported functions and platforms, and weak specification. Wayland ostensibly supports several dozen targets, but only the tier 1 platforms can be reasonably expected to work. As someone who has tried to use Wayland (and failed) for even a tier-two platform, I can assure you that it’s a nightmare. Bringing it up for an entirely new target would be a hellish experience.

Well, here’s a moral argument: throwing away serviceable computers every couple of years to upgrade is a privilege that not all of your users have, contributes to climate change, and fills up landfills. As far as security is concerned, some matters demand leaving the norm: old hardware is the only kind that can avoid proprietary firmware blobs, Intel ME or AMD PSP, and UEFI. Novel hardware which addresses issues like microcode and open hardware, like POWER9 and RISC-V, are also suffering under Rust’s mainstream-or-bust regime. Anyone left behind is forced to use the legacy X11 applications you’ve abandoned, which is much worse for their security than the hypothetical bugs you’re trying to save them from.<br><br>Wayland is not safe.

This makes it easier and less error prone to reuse code.<br>For example, you can write one sorting function that is capable of sorting integers or text or any other sort of data just by substituting the type parameter.<br>Languages without generics have other polymorphic techniques for accomplishing the same thing but they usually lack type safety. There is more typing and more footguns. For example C has no parametric polymorphism but does have the qsort function. It&#039;s capable of sorting an array of any data but you need to provide extra information manually and if you get it wrong your program blows up.",,,,,,,,1612962193,,,80123635,,,,,,80123635,,,,,,,,,,g

Definitely a good one for a private search but for public stuff its okay to use other stuff. <br>For payment, Cryptocurrency works great IN THEORY but in practice there are lots of issues.  Notably the  volatility, huge transaction fees  and delays especially when using BTC and most of all ETH (and any goddamn  ERC20 token which is basically bolted onto ETH). Monero is by far the best privacy focused currency  and overall functions very well, but crypto is its own thing and right now its not a drop in replacement for PayPal et al with lesser fees - its more like forex speculation. <br>Ungoogled Chromium is the best desktop &quot;chrome/ium&quot; fork, its true but its still Chrome/ium  and contributes to Google control of the web (same with Brave, Edge and any browsers that are based on Chrome/ium). <br>Firefox itself is fine, but Librewolf is essentially a pre-tweaked version that&#039;s okay too. However don&#039;t pretend base Firefox isn&#039;t viable or can&#039;t be tweaked to your preferences.",,,,,,,,1613013888,,,80138727,,,,,,80138727,,,,,,,,,,g

Which is better for what in terms of video game performance/load speeds?<br><br>I bought the Spin Drive as well because the memory volume is far cheaper than SSD memory volume. I have 500GB of SS memory and 2TB of Optical Spin Drive Memory.<br><br>TLDR: How should I partition my memory between SS and Optical Spin for game optimization?

Just picking your brain a bit and learning here.<br><br>It theory your CPU &quot;recalls&quot; or &quot;pulls memory from&quot; SSD far faster than spin drives in part due to the physical distance being shorter between bits.<br><br>So, &quot;better for everything&quot; translates to &quot;it pulls the memory faster and everything loads faster&quot;. So, in practice, say, Skyrim load times entering/exiting buildings and environments will be much faster in comparison. And Skyrim will load much faster. Windows 10 will operate much faster and boot faster.<br><br>Ok, I think I understand. It really is just straight up fucking better at &quot;everything&quot;. So essentially prioritize what&#039;s absolutely critical and work down that list, throwing it all on the SSD until there&#039;s no longer space then move onto the 2TB Spin Drive. Things that are not critical for speed (IE Starship Troopers movie or Wedding Pictures) go on the Spin Drive.<br><br>That about sum it up?",,,,,,,,1613013586,,,80135158,,,,,,80135158,,,,,,,,,,g

You should put all the software you use most frequently on the SSD. Don&#039;t fill it to the brim, because Windows will chew away at some free space over time.

I did a little research when I bought my Western Digital WD BLUE SN550 500GB 2,400Mb/s SSD. Apparently, for queue depth 1 in it&#039;s price range, it&#039;s a God. However, for queue depth 2-8 it&#039;s slightly below average. <br><br>From some testing statistics I saw for various games with a sample size of like, 4 lol, it spat out that around 51% of a game&#039;s operation necessitate a queue depth 1, with 46% being between 2-8 (very rarely so far as 8). With the remainder number in that percentile being some overly technical BS that&#039;s not applicable to me really. For reference I think the games were Crysis 3 on Very High, Battlefield 4 on Very High, World of Warcraft and some other shit.<br><br>Another TLDR; Anything about queue depth I should know about or is pertinent to rig building for games?",,,,,,,,1613014031,,,80135158,,,,,,80135158,,,,,,,,,,g

You want to roll a d6 in your code. Since we&#039;re not allowed to be impure, that means we need to lug around a random number generator into all of our functions. That&#039;s kind of annoying that we need to do that. Instead, we can make all of our functions not care about it in the input, and make a minor change about the type they return, basically saying &quot;instead of just returning this value, call PutItInABox on it first, a function you don&#039;t need to know the implementation of. Now all of your stuff looks like a -&gt; Box&lt;a&gt; so you get to use all of the monad machinery. And the particular monads in question can implement extra functions; monad is just a bare interface, it doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t do extra shit. The random monad basically wraps a random number generator inside of the state monad, and lets you use functions to read the rng out, advance it one stage, getting the random result, and put the updated rng back into your state. These appear to you as magic DSL functions that you just get access to by virtue of putting your stuff inside of this box - in reality it&#039;s because they&#039;re methods of the box.",,,,,,,,1613013504,,,80138738,,,,,,80138738,,,,,,,,,,g

Now you&#039;re leaning so much on that helper function, you can add special syntax to your language where it will call it between every single line of code.

The fact that haskell uses monads for IO is deceptive because the real special thing about haskell IO is that you program doesn&#039;t bake the cake, it just outputs a recipe for someone to follow. The thing following the recipe is the haskell runtime server, written in c, and embedding in your haskell program when your compile it. All your code does is output instructions in a certain protocol that says &quot;hey, IO server, could you print this line to the screen for me?&quot; or &quot;could you read the value of this file for me?&quot; . The fact that this is best done using the monad pattern to hide things away is, whilst historically important, because it&#039;s basically the reason we started using monads in the first place, kind of irrelevant to the general pattern.",,,,,,,,1613013780,,,80138738,,,,,,80138738,,,,,,,,,,g

I meant to say - save up more of your money to buy a GMMK instead of a Tecware Phantom (the GMMK has MX-compatible hotswap sockets verses the Outemu-style hotswap sockets on the Phantom).  When ordering the GMMK, you can customize your order and reduce the cost by choosing no keycaps and no keyswitches.  You can buy the same or better keycaps and/or keyswitches elsewhere for less.  You can save even more money by waiting for the GMMK to go on sale, but they are usually only on sale for Black Friday (day after Thanksgiving) and Christmas.",,,,,,,,1613012640,,,80136957,,,,,,80136957,,,,,,,,,,g

It&#039;s very fast and has low static friction. Only major drawback is it&#039;s very sensitive to dirt. This could be a problem if you eat at your desk or live in a filthy hovel. But it&#039;s also easy to clean with a microfiber cloth, and because it&#039;s glass it shouldn&#039;t wear out (assuming you don&#039;t use ceramic mouse feet). Minor drawbacks are it&#039;s noisier than some mousepads, and it feels cold to the touch at first.<br><br><a href=""#p80138403"" class=""quotelink"">&gt;&gt;80138403</a><br>My Skypad 2.0 feels a lot faster than any desk I&#039;ve ever used.",glassblack-900x900,.png,900.0,900.0,125.0,125.0,1613009791024.0,1613009791,nW3UpbqKXIzAsIu/RAWXYw==,73549.0,80138367,,,,,,80138367,,,,,,,,,,g

In that sense, they&#039;re very much like poettering and crew. That&#039;s NOT a good thing for an OS. Dragonflybsd and netbsd do not have these problems.<br>I&#039;m happy it&#039;s not systemd/linux as it&#039;s now a dead project, but the fact that the project pretends linux is too hard and that&#039;s why they chose freebsd is retarded. Linux and freebsd as exactly as hard, their interface tweaks can easily be implemented on top of linux (on a related note, see gobolinux).

You could probably salvage anything but the module and microcontroller, but those are cheap anyway, and if you don&#039;t want a smart phone you probably want your own screen and buttons, modern feature phone buttons tend to suck.

It&#039;s about knowing what tools are available for you, knowing the limits of your language, finding solutions to your problems, and being able to architect an efficient solution in a timely manner. At the very least these paper tests should be multiple choice.<br>I&#039;ve been a lead flutter developer for a YEAR, but left to do web again for half a year.

I used to love watching lots of talks about new stuff coming to linux, but i notice there, too, the old &#039;feel&#039; is long gone and it&#039;s mostly empty words and marketing. Free software can be pretty great but the way linux distros are setup and how most software is spread makes it hard to keep running older software with new system updates, which means as a user you lose functioning apps and as a developer you have to keep racing to keep your app working with new changes which becomes rather demotivating after a while (see all the dead linux music software projects, for example). If everyone switched to haiku for front end, we could have a more stable base for software development, but in all cases many apps died in the dynamically-linked-distro-grinder and many more will die in such move to haiku or whatever big update comes in the linux ecosystem to fuck all your old stuff (like some fancy new d-bus replacement).",,,,,,,,1613000706,,,80134905,,,,,,80134905,,,,,,,,,,g

5767,80138642,,,02/10/21(Wed)20:48:51,Anonymous,American culture is centered around niggers. They have holidays for niggers. They killed hundreds of thousands of white men to free niggers. They listen to nigger music. They elect a nigger as their president. They dress and act like niggers. They draw the entirety of their modern culture from niggers. They post sassy gifs about niggers. They watch sportsball in worship of niggers. Their biggest event of the year involves throwing parties in honor of niggers playing sports. They use nigger slang like &quot;bruh&quot; and &quot;thot&quot;. When you say &quot;Martin Luther&quot; they&#039;re not thinking of the father of protestantism. They&#039;re thinking of the nigger. Their cities are completely overrun with niggers. They worship their ZOGbot police force disproportionately filled with niggers and their global police force of soldiers filled with niggers. Their men sit around watching nigger ball while their women sit around watching nigger talk shows and fantasizing about nigger dick. They worship niggers like Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson and the late Eddie Murphy while attacking the whites who actually built their country before niggers took over. Their movies are filled with niggers and their music charts are topped by niggers. They send niggers to the Olympics and celebrate when the niggers win because those niggers are true red blooded american niggers. They watch nigger porn to a point where &quot;BBC&quot; does not make them think of an international media company but about nigger penises instead. They will tell you how much they hate niggers and how the mutt&#039;s law meme is a stale joke and they are just pretending to love niggers but the evidence speaks for itself in that America has always been and will be a nation of nigger loving niggers.,,,,,,,,1613008131,,,80136780,,,,,,80136780,,,,,,,,,,g

Id recommend setting that to 0 so it only loads the page youre currently looking at,  i think by default it will load 2 images on either side of what you&#039;re currently viewing. Maybe i could add a setting so the full view can use samples instead of full res image which should help with low memory devices.

I think it&#039;s running out of RAM when fetching every single thumbnail. I hate to compare but this never happens with apps like Kuroba and Flexbooru, so there&#039;s probably something that can be improved there. Can&#039;t you fetch images as you scroll instead of getting everything at once?

Each manga should be in zip or cbz format, with the author/group/title and preferably the nhentai ID in the file name, it looks like they are fine as they are safe for the ID, which would be useful, but it&#039;s not as important as the rest. Some tags may be worth considering, but very long file names should be avoided.<br><br>They should definitely not be in big tars or anything like that. The reason for this is simple: when you want to download something or find something for downloaded, all you have to do is type the author or title in the search bar, and select what you want in the torrent client. This way, even people who don&#039;t have the autism and/or the storage space to download all 1.5TB of data can both download, search, and seed parts of the collection. This organization also allows convenient direct access to your downloaded collection. I believe this user-friendly approach can contribute the most to the convenience and long-term availability of the project. <br><br>I don&#039;t see the point in organizing the collection by upload or release date as that information bares no relevance to cooming. I honestly have no problem with having all cbzs in one folder; you will probably do a search to access a single file in almost all cases. It is the simplest method, and it helps with the next point.<br><br>When you update the collection, you can just release a new torrent that contains all the previous files so you could choose the same directory and your client would automatically check the ones you already have.

You will create disasters of such a scale that the whole project will die and it will be many years of study before you realize that you fucked up.  C++ projects absolutely require highly skilled gatekeepers that force you to use their coding standards and don&#039;t let your code in without review.

6803,80108319,,,02/09/21(Tue)04:16:46,Anonymous,"I&#039;m the anon who just got the Mangird Tea in the other thread. I also bought Galaxy Buds+ for the convenience of TWS. Other reason I ordered it is after they released Buds Pro they took $50 off the Buds+ price, bringing it into the $100 range which is about as much as I want to pay for TWS.<br><br>It&#039;s definitely the best sounding TWS I&#039;ve had, though the Haylou GT1 Plus or XR isn&#039;t that far behind. The FR is nearly straight Harman. Everything I&#039;ve listened to on them so far sounds about as it should. It&#039;s definitely nowhere near the Tea in terms of detail, instrument separation and so forth, so it&#039;s not good for critical listening / masturbating over fine details, but it&#039;s very musical, exciting and fun for casual listening. A bit like what the Oppoties are in relation to high end IEMs. I do hear a bit of the &quot;bitcrushed&quot; sounding highs Crin mentions, and it would annoy me if I was listening critically, but they&#039;re not really good for that anyway and it doesn&#039;t make them sound noticeably worse for casual use.<br><br>The other big improvement vs my GT1 XR is quality of life stuff like customizable touch actions, edge tap to adjust volume, and ambient passthrough.<br><br>It comes with an onboard EQ I don&#039;t really get the purpose of since it&#039;s just 5 presets and Samsung devices already come with an EQ that&#039;s way more versatile. The only plus I can think of is that it carries over the same setting when I connect them to my PC. Of the presets, dynamic sounded the best for the pop music I was listening to, but it just makes it more V shaped and I settled on &quot;off&quot;, which I&#039;m guessing probably improves the battery life anyway.<br><br>Bluetooth range is as good as on any audio device I&#039;ve used, but slightly better with my phone than my PC, thanks to the proprietary Samsung Scalable codec. Sadly it only supports that, AAC and SBC. This is great for phones, but almost no PCs support AAC, so you get stuck with SBC. No AptX is probably because it uses a Broadcom SoC running RTOS, not a Qualcom chip.",,,,,,,,1612862206,,,80107752,,,,,,80107752,,,,,,,,,,g

Thieaudio Clairvoiance has a bass boost that starts sooner, those will probably have fuller bass (again an impedance plug increases bass response in tgese too). Beyerdynamic Xelento and Empire Ears Legend X both have a huge bass boost, worth auditioning if you are a bass head and can find a place to audition them.

I&#039;d call their sound excellent. Only two real gripes I have are there&#039;s maybe a bit much bass for some genres (but the &quot;treble boost&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; EQ modes built into them mostly fix this), and there&#039;s some distortion in the highs making cymbals sound kinda cheapy (I think this is what Crin referred to as sounding &quot;bitcrushed&quot;).<br>Oh, also, if you get them, get the phone app. It lets you customize the controls, lock them if you&#039;re pausing your music accidentally, change EQ presets, make them chirp loudly in case you&#039;ve dropped one and can&#039;t find it, etc. There&#039;s also an open source Galaxy Buds Manager for Windows that gives slightly more control if you use it with your PC. Note that you&#039;re stuck with SBC on PC though since they only support SBC, AAC and Samsung Scalable Codec. They also don&#039;t do multipoint pairing but they&#039;re the only earphones I&#039;ve had that you can just click connect on a paired device and they drop the connection to whatever else they&#039;re connected to, so they&#039;re a lot quicker than average to switch between devices.",,,,,,,,1612999889,,,80107752,,,,,,80107752,,,,,,,,,,g

But if you&#039;re on 1440p/144hz or any other combination of high res and/or high refresh, you&#039;re going to need more. <br><br>Plus it all depends on the timing of when someone needs/wants to upgrade, when they last built a PC, etc. For me, I built my first desktop in 2011 with an HD7850. I held out for as long as I could, and didn&#039;t upgrade my GPU until 2019 when I upgraded everything and got a 5700XT, which IMO was the best value card on the market at that time.",,,,,,,,1612984065,,,80134201,,,,,,80134201,,,,,,,,,,g

That way, you can still rotate your certificate (as long as you keep the same CA) or free up the domain (either by revocation or by CA trust expiration) for others to use.<br>My point here is that Gemini&#039;s approach to this is incredibly naive and far easier to exploit than standard PKI is (e.g. someone on a school or airplane network who MITM&#039;s all initial connections probably wouldn&#039;t care if everyone got warnings about trust conflicts later on as long as they&#039;ve scrapped all the passwords and moved on already).",,,,,,,,1612955908,,,80126032,,,,,,80126032,,,,,,,,,,g

A framework provides a structure to the code. Vue for example, has one component per file, which bundles the ui template for a single component with the logic for that template. It provides functionality like having the ui update if a variable changes without the developer having to manually do that.<br><br>JQuery on the other hand is mostly used as a slower non-standard document.querySelectorAll. And if you want a wrapper for network requests, axios is better at that anyway. It does not provide any more protection against spaghetti code as vanilla JS. Technically it is a polyfill, and a polyfill for stuff that is almost all supported, even for internet explorer 11.<br><br>JQuery was never an alternative for frameworks. And claiming the only alternative to jQuery is a bloated framework is dishonest.",,,,,,,,1612975744,,,80128076,,,,,,80128076,,,,,,,,,,g

Generally, using them together is a pain in the ass. But often you have to because JQuery is one of the most common dependencies JS modules tend to have. So some shitty library will pull it into the project no matter what and you&#039;re damned to deal with that bullshit on a quasi daily basis.<br>As a user a JQuery style library is much less of a pain than a fully fledged framework. With something like Angular you just get a blank screen without javascript and many sites are starting to fetch images with XHRs nowadays. It all leads to a very bad user experience if you don&#039;t want to allow some random site (and the 15 CDNs it&#039;s using for scripts) to execute code on your computer.",,,,,,,,1612985127,,,80128076,,,,,,80128076,,,,,,,,,,g

Meanwhile every angular, react, npm, etc app I&#039;ve been on is a shitshow just to get it working, nobody knows what the fuck is going on, never builds even if it&#039;s 2, 3 months old.",,,,,,,,1612997794,,,80128076,,,,,,80128076,,,,,,,,,,g

Presently in spite of all the great things about AMD they have been slipping into memevidia/intcel tier mistakes such that they&#039;re just going to end up being the same bullshit as the other companies minus the marketing brainwashing which means that they are going to lose. On top of that memevidia still just barely has the fastest card (3090 but why the fuck would you buy that) with frankly the 6900XT just seeming like an outright scam card despite being $500 cheaper because it&#039;s basically just a better binned 6800XT (which is still the card to get this gen imho) and because of their exorbitant Zen3 prices coupled with the fact they are no longer shipper neato coolers. I literally would never have switched over to AMD and bought a 3700x had it not came with that awesome Prism cooler. I&#039;m sorry but that just was the edge. Had it not gotten a stock cooler I&#039;d basically just be looking at a shittier Intel on the margins because they just can&#039;t turbo as fast and even to this day in 2021 AMD has yet to break the 5ghz barrier, which means that they are objectively inferior CPUs to Intel and I am saying this as someone who won&#039;t shut up about my x570 board and 5700XT. <br><br>I&#039;",,,,,,,,1613005553,,,80125692,,,,,,80125692,,,,,,,,,,g

So I&#039;d be paying $400 and then had to add cooler costs on top of that which basically just knocked me into an entirely separate price bracket has I got an AMD instead. But even still, it&#039;s just down to z390 and z490 being much shittier and more costly boards and with gimped PCIe lanes and no gen4 pcie when I bought it in 2020. That all was fundamentally not worth the 5.1 ghz clock speeds.<br><br>In spite of that, had I the option to build again this year I&#039;d probably simply have gone with Intel. AMD cannot justify their higher prices on top of taking out Wraith Prism coolers. They&#039;re just not that good still. If Zen4 handily breaks 5hz yeah then maybe. I do love my PCIe lanes. But they&#039;re delusional if they think they can pull this shit on us. They&#039;re not that good; they&#039;re AMD. We buy them because they are cheaper, not because we&#039;re expecting a Bugatti. Or at bare minimum, include a cooler as awesome as the Prism so I don&#039;t suddenly need to add the cost and aggravation of now shopping around for an air cooler or whether to get an AIO and watching a couple more hours of reviews.

There&#039;s a difference, I competed in ACM and the top teams were on another planet, known to grind problems for hours and hours every day. They have it optimized, they solve problems in record time but if you look at the code they are basically code golfing in real time, and pulling in really heavyweight algorithms (that a dedicated 9000WPM typer on their team will type up from textbooks like a human copy paste) if it makes the problem even slightly easier to write up or more likely to pass the time constraints. And then once the competition is done, you toss the code and never look at it again.

The way that they&#039;re equal is a value, with the type &quot;A=B&quot;. Lets say foo and bar are two different ways that a and b are equal, then you can find a way to assert that the two different ways of being equal are themselves equal in some sense, and you keep going up and up an infinite hierarchy. This is related to homotopy type theory where types are described as paths through space that we can talk about smoothy transforming. You&#039;ll see this in languages like agda, and maybe lean but I think it actually doesn&#039;t particularly care about keeping around explicit proof witnesses in order to avoid something called setoid hell)",,,,,,,,1613005951,,,80132509,,,,,,80132509,,,,,,,,,,g

Like say you want to log your single argument function. To do this functionally you need to pass the whole log in as an argument and spit the whole log out with your new stuff appended. It&#039;d be nicer if you could just output the difference, but then you have the issue where you want to chain these functions but you&#039;ve got a type of a -&gt; (Log changes, a) instead of a -&gt; a and now they don&#039;t chain. You can manually destructure the output tuple to get the value you need and manage the log changes yourself, but now you&#039;re writing a load of gross code to stick shit together.

This is the legendary &quot;bind&quot; that&#039;s in the haskell logo, and it&#039;s also called flatMap in scala, which is more helpful except you have to remember it&#039;s a mapping first, then flattening out the extra layer. <br><br>Because this pattern occurs so often when trying to stick together things that produce awkward boxes made up of the results plus  some extra bullshit you care about, haskell provides syntax sugar for it baked into the language. This MapAndSquish function is overloaded depending on the type, so you just use the MapAndSquish function and so long as the person who wrote the type of the pain in the ass box you&#039;re using implemented it for that type, that particular implementation of mapping then squishing will get called. This makes the syntax sugar usable for basically everything that looks roughly like this problem. The syntax sugar is called do notation, and you might encounter it when writing your very first haskell program because descriptions of IO effects are done using an awkwardly shaped type of the kind we&#039;ve talked about above. Your haskell program never actually writes to the screen - it just outputs special instructions that get interpreted when your program runs by a part of the haskell system called the runtime. So your code is actually spitting out instructions in a DSL, and all the impure stuff is basically handled by a server written in C, baked into your program when you compile it.",,,,,,,,1613007830,,,80132509,,,,,,80132509,,,,,,,,,,g
