It went into the history of gassers, build types, classes, anything you&#039;d want to know. I&#039;ll try to find it again.<br><br>Anyways, the gist of it was that just like hot rodding, gassers had a humble beginning. They started off as people&#039;s daily drivers who wanted to race them, but didn&#039;t have the money/space for a dedicated race car. Yes they would hop up the motor the best that they could, but it still needed to run on pump gas (hence the name &quot;gasser&quot;). Not all of them had motor swaps or insane work done to them, which is why they were placed in classes (classes were curb weight/displacement, so there were classes for straight 6s, even 4cyls). Yes they could pull the seats out on race day to save weight, but some would do modifications that were permanent but could be lived with on the road. That&#039;s where the straight axle swap came in, and raising the front for better traction. Eventually the gasser craze took off and people started pushing the limits of what was essentially a street car into what we know today. Hell, today&#039;s gassers would be considered street freaks, a whole other genre of gasser cars.",download (5),.jpg,245.0,206.0,125.0,105.0,1612815109416.0,1612815109,THiFi4BR1B6DdXMfdLGybQ==,10691.0,23538405,,,,,23538405,,,!Q2.xvfWyOo,,o

You most definitely need a shroud even with electric dual fans you need a shroud to guide the air flow in otherwise its wildly ineffective. That&#039;s probably your main problem <br>2.)&quot;electric fans in the front&quot;. As in, in front of the radiator pushing air in? You want them behind the radiator pulling air in, reposition them, with a proper shroud, and reverse the power and ground wires so that they&#039;re pulling air in <br>3.) Three core is a meme. Usually they use 3 small ass width core with horrible fin counts and fin to air contact and airflow restrictions. The cores essentially all cockblock eachothers airflow and pro-war the air as it moves back so the 3rd one is pretty much useless and now your back to only having 2 except now they&#039;re smaller than your oem 2 core ones and thus worse. A good performance aluminum rad with 2 FAT ass 1&quot; or wider cores is the best. Most 3 core radiators dont even list individual core width as a spec cuz it&#039;s usually some small shit like 5/8&quot; and with the last one being virtually useless u end up having less overall cooling than a wide 2 core.<br>Link related <br>https://help.summitracing.com/app/a<wbr>nswers/detail/a_id/5281/~/is-a-3-ro<wbr>w-radiator-better-than-a-2-row%3F",,,,,,,,1612932706,,,23538405,,,,,23538405,,,,,o

The oil filter is connected to an adapter plate that mounts to front driver side of engine. The gasket for that plate is very prone to failure at the age \ miles of your car. I have never heard of catastrophic blowout from that problem but very common to develop leakage from gasket. My 2 cases were both oil leaks from that source but coolant goes through there too. an oil passage and coolant passage are both through that plate so if you find coolant leakage at front drivers side, inpect that oil filter adapter area very closely. if you think you are closing in, look up youtube vids for oil filter adapter gasket for ford 4.6 and you will find lots of vids.",,,,,,,,1612874035,,,23550116,,,,,23550116,,,,,o

Sometimes it&#039;s the air sensor going bad (more common if you have a MAF) but can also come from vacuum leaks after the sensor so that it&#039;s not really metering the amount of air getting in.<br><br>O2 failures are expensive and usually kind of rare compared to other problems. I don&#039;t know what kind of O2 sensors a 2010 civic uses, but I&#039;d guess it&#039;s not some super-complicated german-style thing and if it starts to read a little bit off you&#039;d just be looking at bad fuel mileage or persistent stumbling most of the time rather than only hunting at idle/start.<br><br>Coolant temperature sensor might be another concern if it&#039;s not detecting that it&#039;s cold out. Clogged up IAC motor or wonky TPS sensor would be also-rans but I&#039;d put that further down on the list. IAC you can clean by spraying carb cleaner or whatever into it while holding the engine above a stall. TPS would manifest as bucking or bad throttle feel off idle at all times and not just starting/cold.<br><br>I&#039;d be more interested to find a cable for your phone from ebay to read whatever freeze-frame data might be hiding in the OBDII port before spending money on a new O2 sensor, but you could consult a honda forum first in case this is a common issue with a known typical fix.",,,,,,,,1612928249,,,23550116,,,,,23550116,,,,,o

Way back in the early 2000s I was 20 and had just gotten married. We found out we were pregnant not long after so we decided that we needed a good family car so we kept my old truck as an emergency vehicle and woods toy and went to the dealership and found the perfect car. It was a Jetta and my wife had to have it because it was the only one on the lot that was the blue exterior/black interior she wanted. The only issue was that it was the 1.8t manual and neither of us knew how to drive stick. So the sales guy took me to the closed bank parking lot next door and in about 20 minutes taught me the basics. I drove it home from Brunswick to Waycross without a single stall out. Did have some growing pains (the wife still can&#039;t confidently drive manual but she didn&#039;t even get her license till she was 20) but that was a great little car and I&#039;ve owned several manual cars in the time since.",,,,,,,,1613014445,,,23559250,,,,,23559250,,,,,o

You want a nimble car to navigate curves and at that point the specific horsepower figure isn&#039;t as important as its relationship to the cars weight. <br>You&#039;re asking if there is such a thing as too much because you know a car you can&#039;t drive at 10/10ths is one you can&#039;t really enjoy.

The Chinese strategy for selling cars is simply making them cheaper with their low costs labor, there are Chinese brands that are equitable with western brands such as Hongqi, Geely or Great Wall but those cost pretty much the same as western, Korean or Japanese brands so their big incentive is kind of moot. Only way for them to really compete in North America would be to build their cars in North America. They tried building and selling Chinese cars in Mexico and they were so bad, they got laughed out of the Mexican market. Even though they were the cheapest cars you could buy in Mexico even poor people there instead just opted to buy slightly more expensive VW, Hyundai, Nissan, Kia, GM, Ford Mazda or Toyota models.",,,,,,,,1612953548,,,23555494,,,,,23555494,,,,,o

Average home income in Mexico is $20,000 but the average Mexican car owner has a vehicle that&#039;s worth $25,000-$30,000 all in. They tend to buy nicer cars than most thirdies because the roads are bad and they usually keep cars for 12-15 years so want something that will last a long time in bad environments. Long warranties are common there. It&#039;s why pickups are common there despite being relatively expensive compared to incomes too. You can get a 12 year full warranty on the BMW 3 series in Mexico and they run at less than $30,000 there.

A little over a month ago I made a thread about how I bought my first bike from a mechanic friend. 2006 Yamaha Roadstar 1700. I was intimidated by its size and weight at first, but now I&#039;m really confident riding it and I fucking love it. A couple dudes said I was an idiot for getting that as my first bike. they were probably right, but most anons were cool and gave me helpful tips and that gave me a good confidence boost. <br>Anyways, recently I noticed my choke is &quot;stuck&quot; in an on position. When I first got it there were like 3 choke settings. Pushing the choke in turned it off completely, then I could pull it half way out, and pull it all the way out. It seems stuck in the middle setting and the choke won&#039;t turn off completely when I push it back it. As a result it gets pretty hot pretty fast and im afraid of it over heating. Any way to simply fix this or am I better off taking it to the shop?<br>pic related",20210105_232851,.jpg,4032.0,1960.0,125.0,60.0,1612938413749.0,1612938413,fr+WhvR1puXK4rI4yS4qvw==,2378445.0,23555748,,,,,23555748,,,,,o

This is a classic case of biker rage and why it shouldn&#039;t be encouraged. Sure, the gentleman in the car opened the door, which may have put the rider in harm&#039;s way while filtering, but the blame mostly lies on the rider for filtering at such a high speed. Remember the SMART system for safe riding and in this situation, I&#039;d call it total brown stage. That&#039;s right. It&#039;s a straight badunk in the trunk time for this rider since he&#039;s not looking for obvious signs of danger out there on the road. I keep telling you, guys.

I&#039;m on the latter. The former&#039;s argument is flawed because you can still get t-boned by a long-nose big rig in a car and go full pepsi, just as the same as on a bike. I say go ahead and learn how to ride a bike first. Winter&#039;s probably almost over for your side of the world so it would be alright to ride and learn in fair-weather conditions.

I also like 90s-00s dance music which is non existant today. I like European electronic music of early 00s as a whole. Melodic, bass pumping (hints of rave), easy going vocal, and music that you can actually dance to.

To me that&#039;s a brand new car that will last another 200k miles with minimal maintenance<br>And there&#039;s a good chance with the current geopolitcal agenda being pushed universally, everywhere, that gasoline and diesel engines are going to be gone in 10 years anyways. I&#039;m pretty sure both of my 22R&#039;s are going to last that long lol. And even if I&#039;m wrong, I doubt I&#039;ll last more than 20 years",,,,,,,,1612889813,,,23548765,,,,,23548765,,,,,o

There&#039;s no grinding or other odd noise or feel, it just takes a noticeable amount of time to enter the gear instead of a quick moment and then slipping in like all the other gears as it should be.

A 400hp Forester XT is an ebay turbo, E85, fuel pump, and decapped injectors in a package that&#039;s been done thousands of times. Probably build one that makes 350whp (~400chp) for $8000. <br>Definitely not the I4 rav 4, those rods will snap really quick. The V6, you&#039;ve got some room to play with but there&#039;s no way you&#039;re getting a supercharger, injectors, fuel pump, and tune for that with $6k. Especially when I&#039;m pretty sure they need an aftermarket ECU that&#039;ll cost you over a grand, probably two grand, and the Forester can be flash tuned on its own ECU. Can you even get the V6 with a manual? Will the auto even handle 400hp?
